welcome to Taiwan talks I'm your host weni U as Donald Trump prepares to take

office the world is watching his semiconductor policies today we're

joined by a special guest Dr jingu Who

has many titles among them UC Berkeley

Professor National metal Science and

Technology recipient as well as the

father of 3D transistor finet which is

coined and inhaled as the Revolutionary modern technology for

semiconductors today welcome Doctor Who

let's start with uh tsmc where you were

their first Chief technology officer many years ago um it's also become one

of the most talked about companies in the world

um how do you think about uh is

globalized ation strategy these days uh

obviously we know that it's set up two

factories now in Arizona uh one in Japan

the other in Germany and maybe more coming um do you think this is a good

strategy for tsmc overall I think it's a good strategy it's definitely going to be good for the

stockholders it's a rare opportunity that the company you know gets the

cooperation of so many localities

countries and governments and even

financing yeah for for you to expand so

um that's going to be good for the business of um of tsmc and I think for

all the countries that are inviting tsmc to set up shops it's a challenge for the

Taiwan government which always says they want tsmc to keep the rootes here it's

going to be challenged um there was some debate in

Taiwan uh when tsmc announced that it was going to set up factories in Arizona

um there was this concern of hollowing

out uh the most advanced uh Technologies

and what's your thought just knowing the

company you know tsmc is a great company so I'm sure they have thoughts through

all the things they needed to do um so

that they could keep the R&D uh in

Taiwan and uh um but Taiwan you know it

has limited resources including

educational and uh honestly population

resource so how can um um a huge company

um gets such a limited resources to do what needs needs to do for the world and

that is going to be a great challenge for the management as well as for Taiwan

government but Morris Chang the founder has also said before that the success of

tsmc is is you know due to this special sort of almost like an ecosystem that

was created in Taiwan um and so relocating or

replicating that model may not be as

easy in in other Loc ations um what what

do you think I agree with him I think

tsmc will be wise to um keep the

successful operation in Taiwan especially in R&D I think taian

continues to hold some cost

advantages but you know once um you have

um significant um operation in countries

like uh us uh there will be continued um

attraction for you to bring um you know closer to closer to your most advanced

technology there and clients clients some clients will want that as

well yeah so there will be a lot of

incentives to um um bring the US

operation almost up to par with Taiwan

and we will see how tsmc um can make manage what they want to do I believe

they want to keep the roots in Taiwan

yeah well obviously tsmc has been viewed

as um silicon Shield uh for Taiwan I don't know how you personally

think about this concept of silicon Shield um I don't have much thought

about it but I really like the way

um the um former C uh CEO mark um Lou he

was the CEO of tsmc when this concept was first floated in the media media and

he was more or less asked that question uh um on when he was interviewed on the

60 Minutes yes yeah and I think he said that just right he said um I'm

paraphrasing you know if China attacks Taiwan is it's not going to be because of

tsmc if China does not attack Taiwan it's not going to because of tsmc I want

to mention Morris Chang famously said Global globalization is dead um and the

success of at least in the past semiconductor industry is because of

this Global supply chain and almost like every company plays a very unique role

and these

days um because of geopolitics it may be

different um do you think the cost this

will drive up the cost of producing

semiconductors and then therefore maybe affecting how the worlds you know the

cost of all the chips and as well as Electronics cost I think it will you know

semiconductor um price is has always been priced to be

extremely attractive extremely affordable as a result um there are more

more applications there are more uh uh demand and now you know every one of us

have dozens even not hundred of chips on

a person um and uh so this the reason

the cost can be kept so low is because it's a large competition and there a

many companies and in fact many countries

pouring billions of dollars into every reg generation of Technology you know

because you phrase this question more about cost and I I believe you meant of

course cost to the to the users yeah

customers exactly um you know before

um the uh Trump started the um um trade

War yeah the trade War let's say um the

general concern about in the in the

semiconductor industry is that wow China will start a price War it's going to

totally drive down the cost of semiconductors K IND because they were

investing lots of money to develop that right and if that had not been stopped

by this trade War then we would not be sitting here worried about the cost so if

you you know uh stop the globalization of course still will be cause associate

with it the efficiency will be gone the investment will be less competition will be less yes that will favor some

companies including tsmc you know otherwise tsmc would face the very

Fierce competition from China as well um so yes there will be um impact on the

cost no question about it and it feels like more recently especially because of

AI uh which will need very Advanced

trips to power AI that there's even more

demand uh for advanced semiconductor

chips so what is the future of this

indust I mean this sector you the inventor of finfet which in my view

prolonged the life of you know semiconductor chips it keeps it you know shrinking and getting smaller and

smaller but how much smaller can the chips go um it can be smaller

but cannot follow more so-called Mo law uh forever

we know that uh um Mo law is about doubling the number of chips um every

two years yeah every every two years yes

and um you know it's just like um how

they um human gra brain develops from the time in Theo the the brain starts

with one cell and before long it's two that's four then eight but you cannot

continue forever you know by the end of one year age a child's braing basically

fully developed right after that it's all through learning and you increase

the capability and uh his and her you know ability just cannot be predicted it

can be immense right so right now it's two nanometers right is that the

smallest yes so so the point is that you

cannot assume that the the mor law can

continue forever so um if we change what

the Dr Chan said about globalization is that you could say more SL de and I'm

not saying that because I think that would be mised by a lot of people I'm

really saying is that it's like human brain cannot go grow forever but you

also don't need to grow forever because when it's get to large enough scale you

have more structure indust enough in brain then you can have other ways to

develop doesn't have to be bigger to be better you can learn you can do things

differently a coincident you know since the introduction of ffat because it

showed that you could improve

the speed so much reduce the power

consumption so much that

customers are willing to pay more per

thing fat compared to the preener region

rather than the first 50 years or 60 years of the IC industry where the

customer always expected and demanded lower price

per transistor than the previous generation

that is why transistors keep growing on the chip but the Chip Price more or less

stayed in the same order magnitude that's surprising and this is in spite

the fact that each chip contains manys more transistor than decades ago but but

the the ship price did not increase by more than other magnitude it's always a

few dollars a chip right maybe $20 a chip but you know once F fat show C what

you can do is not just through cost but through

the Innovation the better technology you can improve the speed so much reduce the

power consumption and heat dissipation so much that so that there are more

things that can be done with the chip

including ai ai exactly and therefore

the market can grow without

just relying on war law to cut cost and I think that will be the way to think

about semiconductors you know more law definitely will not continue long the

way it's phrased and now that most people like you uh who have really

looked at definition understand but I think most people actually probably

thinks more SL just about the industry the technology continue to improve and

grow in that sense it will definitely continue because it can do so much for

the world well you also mentioned the power consumption um your invention

obviously helps reduce the uh Reliance

on on the power um but with again with

the boom of AI um and so it seems that

uh the energy uh required to manufacture

the chips in order to power AI uh is

going up again so is that going to pose

a challenge uh to the world when it comes to energy and sustainability not

to the world to Taiwan yes okay um so CU you're asking about energy used to

produce these chips right useful as they are but it does take energy to produce

them so I think um you know many viewers probably immediately think about oh is

you know chip manufacturing a problem for global warming right for the future

of the world so let me just uh um you know address your question from that

angle right then we talk about Taiwan

right uh you know definitely um chip

manufacturing is not a burden on the global warming or going to make it worse

in fact is going to make much better we're going to really need more chips to deal with the challenge of global

warming I

just ask you to think back to the to the

um um the coic crisis time right um very

quickly showed even what the chips could do at that time we could already

basically replaced All Automotive traffic all airplane traffic traffic and

people really didn't Misfit quite really in their work in their even study it's

not ideal but it's manageable right even with technology that time in fact even

before the co probably most people never um even heard about Zoom but it's

already there waiting for its day and uh

so imagine if the global warming became much worse and we're going to really cut

out carbon intensive Industries do you think they would prefer to shut down tsmc or

semiconduct industry or they will want to just re replace the traffic on the uh

by car and replace the airplane traffic right so so from the

the future of the world from the global Waring point of view let's put this

question aside no semic not a problem it's a solution all right and

fortunately we have this because we're probably going to need more of it to

deal with other problems global warming will bring and uh

semiconductor is the most power efficient way to really increase our human ability to solve problems by

another order of magnitude who knows we may need that if power if global warming

really comes you know at full force and and uh you know we fail to do enough so

you're basically saying that uh more avanced chips will be able to

power better technologies that will be more energy

efficient to the world I mean we we see

we we see EVS as an example right that's

the the the story of the uh um high-tech

or the digital techn Tey right what about Taiwan okay so no return to your

question but think it from Taiwan point of view now Taiwan is a small place very

limited resources not just energy resources you know I'm very concerned about it's educational resource the

population resource right but energy is but let's think about energy yes is a

big absolutely true yeah you know many different ways to look at this um lot of

the um people are complaining that the semiconduct industry you know led by

tsmc has already bought out all the green energies in Taiwan so in other

words tsmc is doing you know what it can based on the rule game now right that is

you should you know invest in green energy buy them right and give them the

the fund to build more so tsmc is being criticized for doing too much much but

it can't afford to do it of course and that's the only thing they can do so

know only the government can figure out from a national scale what's the answer

to that right uh even buying out all the

green Energy may not be enough to your

question even for tsmc right so um you

know I personally think nuclear power is unavoidable you know it's a necessary

evil but it I know that's highly

unpopular still and may not come to pass

if not then we'll have to see right

right um well given taiwan's Advantage

um and Leadership on on in this industry um but we also know that many other

countries are trying to compete uh for the advantage uh having

that Advantage you know whether it's the government Japan even Vietnam Malaysia

India you know UAE you you can name it all these

countries are trying are vying for the leadership as well um do you think

Taiwan can continue to lead on semiconductors I I think the you know

game is for it to lose right if it plays the right they should be able to you

know you have already touched down limitations I I have um um already

mentioned it will be pressure for them

for tsmc to you know to um um move more

more of the operation

overseas so so in your view it makes

business sense for tsmc to expand

globally um you know looking at a case of the US um I don't think tsmc even has

a um um viable option right the um um you

know the threat of the tariffs and all

that and the uh um the request of the

customers and all those makes the

decision makes sense yeah yeah yeah well

I I want to ask you also about um us leadership on semiconductors because uh

we know that the chips Act uh during the Biden Administration was

primarily trying to onshore uh or Reon Shure um us

capabilities in in this

industry um and uh the biss use uh

subsidies as the tool to do that um it's a rumor that Trump Administration may

use may not use subsidies and they will use tax incentives maybe as a way and

then maybe tariff do you think the US can reclaim the leadership on semiconductors I mean we we see the case

of I mentioned that because Intel's development recently um has

gotten a lot of people's attention my question is how much can the government

do to help private

companies um be a leader in

semiconductors I think incentives um you know probably would be um um a very

effective way to do

that and that probably is the um um

least hurtful or so at least the the target company um uh get some

benefit incentives okay and uh can can

we just also ask a question about um Nvidia and you know the Taiwanese gang

so I was at a recent uh talk that Jensen

Hong um gave in Washington DC and he said when he was a teenager his dream

was to become a semiconductor engineer what is this thing about Taiwanese and

semiconductor Engineers is this yeah is this like a

Taiwanese thing or

something definitely not right I I think

it's a in a matter of U um um time you

know we're all about the age [Music]

um such that after we graduate from the University in the case for Jensen he

actually attend the University in the US but it's still um and he's much younger like you know the generation that your

generation was kind of the first generation that started this yeah yeah

and but but um you know

so when we finished the University at um um in the in the US it was the booming

time for Semiconductor yes you you you are right that I'm kind of a head of the pack of

this that generation right so I was very lucky when I um when I entered the

University of California it was just a

year after Intel Intel's fing

mhm and uh 196 9 so when uh Jensen and

um ISU graduated you know semiconduct

was a fast growing industry um if you talk about the rate

of annual growth that was the time when the industry Grows by 20% a year right

but the base of course is low you know very well how that's different today although the rate is small but the

amount of the bill hundreds billion doar a year grows much bigger than that time

but that was the the growing period and you know being immigrant we have no

baggage you know no family uh business

to consider um so the choice quite

simple um it's the um semiconductor it's not like there are so that many uh

choices and if I may expand on that theme a little bit you know that

actually I think explain a little bit of the success of Taiwan semiconductor

Foundry industry the fact is you know um

in Taiwan um companies are not like the

um us or even the Japanese companies that are conglomerate

conglobate conglomerates yes they could invest the same billion dollars into

manufacturing semiconductor or into their banking division yeah no Intel

does not have a banking division but you you see what I'm saying but G did and G was in semiconductor people don't even

remember that right and uh and semiconductor business has is very

cyclic so yes in good years you you you you you you you grow well that's why we

have this annual growth rate is very high but in the down year that's so

painful so after a CEO has suffered that one at most two cycle he wants to get

out of it so in some sense and and T semiconduct

semiconductor not only because Dr Chan said we want dedicated to this but in

fact if you want the company to do something else it probably cannot do it

doesn't have doesn't have the uh expertise and doesn't not have the

structure to do that and in some sense I

think the generation of the Taiwanese students or immigrants in uh the US

somewhat like that yeah right so we don't have any choices and this is the

growing field so exciting so we want to do it the opportunity and yes we also

work hard and uh you know we are good at

science and we studied hard in school so

we got the um you know right um um knowledge right and we got that uh

single-mindedness mhm so that's what it is thank you so much for um coming to

Taiwan plus today um talking to Taiwan talks
