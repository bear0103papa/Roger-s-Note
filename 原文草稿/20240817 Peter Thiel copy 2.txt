I think you had the church commission hearings in the late 70s and uh and

somehow things things got things got

exposed and um and then um when when things when a bureaucracy is forced to

be formalized um it probably becomes a lot less functional you know um there

was a like the 2000s version there was I think there was a lot of crazy stuff

that we did in Black sites torturing people um that the CIA ran you know in

the war on terror uh water boarding there's all sorts of batshit crazy stuff that happened but then um you know once

John Yu in the bush 43 Administration writes the torture memos and sort of formalizes this is how many times you

can water dunk someone without it being torture etc etc once you formalize it people somehow know that it's on its way

out because you know um it doesn't quite

work anymore so by I don't know by 2007 um at Guantanamo I think the

inmates were running the Asylum the inmates and the defense lawyers were running it you were way safer as a

Muslim terrorist in Guantanamo than as a let's say suspected cop killer in Manhattan there was still an informal

process in Manhattan you were suspected cop killer they'd figure out some way to

um to deal with you out inside the judicial the formal judicial process um and um but I think something there was a

sort of formalization that happened there was the post uh J Edgar Hoover FBI

where Hoover was I don't know a law unto

himself it was completely out of control CIA even more so and then um you know

once it all gets exposed and uh um it it probably is a lot harder to do the

NSA you know NSA probably held up longer as a deep State entity where it at least

had the virtue people you know I think the 1980s it was still referred to as no such agency so it's still it was still

far more obscure so the necessary condition is that if some part of the deep State's doing it you know we we we

can barely know what's going on right with them and then I don't know you know

the the 2000s

2010s history on the on on you know I

think the Patriot Act empowered all

these faisa courts and I think there

was I think there probably um were ways

the NSA fisa court process was was

weaponized in a really really crazy way um and you know it culminated in in 2016

with all the um you know the crazy Russia conspiracy theories against

Trump um but I I think even that I I'm

not sure they can do anymore because it

got exposed can't do that anymore but a

small program that is top secret that is

designed under the offices of protecting American lives extracting information

from people I'm I'm I'm agreeing with you the the NSA fisa court process is is one where you had a pretty out ofc

Control process from let's say Circa I don't know 2003 to 2017 2018 so that's

relatively recent history mhm um I don't know you know they're all the

they're all the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories uh which um I'm

probably too fascinated by um because it felt like there

was there was some crazy stuff going on that they were able to cover up and

still are uh and then but then man doesn't it the

fact that we're still talking about Jeffrey Epstein tell us um how hard it is to come up with anything else no

because there's no answers for the Jeffrey Epstein thing there's been no consequences other than glain Maxwell

going to jail and Jeffrey Epstein allegedly committing suicide which I don't think he did other than that what

are the consequences they they they were able to pull off this thing this some

some sort of operation what you know who knows who was behind it who knows what was the motivation but it clearly has

something to do with compromising people which is an age-old strategy for getting people to do what you want them to do you have things on them you use those

things as leverage and then next thing you know you've got people saying things that you want them to say do and and it

motivate moves policy changes things get things done that they did that yes and

no one and we know they did that and yet no one is asking for the tapes no one's asking asking for the The Client List we

we're in the dark still and probably I don't know man I I

I spend too much time thinking about all all the all the Epstein

variants it pro probably probably the sex stuff is overdone and everything else is underdone it's like with it's

like a limited hangout we get to talk about the crazy underage sex and um and

you know not about all all the other questions it's like when Alex aosta testified for labor secretary under and

he was he was the da who prosecuted Epstein in ' 0809 and um got him sort of

the very light 13-month or whatever uh

sentence and um was it South Florida da

or whatever he was um

and and uh aosta was asked you

know um uh you know why did why did he get off so easily and and under

Congressional testimony when he's up for labor secretary 2017 it was um he belonged to

intelligence that's yeah and then and

then you know um and so it's yeah it's it's it the question isn't about the sex

with the underage women the question is is really about you know why was he why

was he so protected and then you know I I went I I went down all these rabbit holes was he you know working for the

Israelis or the Mad Or all all this sort of stuff and uh I've come to think that

that's that was very secondary it was obviously it was just the US you know you know if you're working for Israel

you don't get protected you know we had Jonathan Paul he went to jail for 25 years or whatever um and um but

unrelated right understood but it's but it's uh but this is one particular operation But but so it's but it it was

uh if if it was an intelligence operation the question we should be asking is what part of the US intelligence right system was was he

working for was he working for you know but don't you think that's an effective strategy for controlling politicians getting them involved in sex scandals I mean that's always been one

of the the worst things that can happen to a politician look at Monica Lewinsky a very simple one consensual

inappropriate sexual relationship between a president and a staffer and it almost takes down the presidency it

causes him to get impeached uh powerful motivators the

shame of it all also the illegal activity the fact that it's I mean it's one of the most disgusting things that we think of with people having sex with

underage people um I'm I'm I'm I'm sure that was

part of it I suspect there are a lot of other questions that uh you know one one one should one should also most

certainly but I would think that that is one of the best motivators that we have is having dirt on people like that

especially something that could ruin your career especially people that are deeply embedded in this system of people

knowing things about people and using those at their advant I mean that's an age-old strategy in politics that was

Jay Edgar Hoover's entire modus Opera my my my my Riff on it was always that it

was um it was it's it's a little bit different from the J Edgar Hoover thing

and the question was always whether the people doing it knew they were getting

compromised and so it's it's it's it

it's the vibe is not that um um um you

somehow got compromised it was more you were joining this uh this secret Club

you got to be made you're a made man in the mafia and you get to do crazy things no no no no it's only if we have comprom

mod on you do you get ahead right it's like you know it's like I don't know it's one of these uh um

yeah closet of the vaan the claim is 80% of the Cardinals in the Catholic church are gay not sure if that's true but uh

directionally it's probably correct and the the basic thesis is you don't get promoted to a cardinal if you're

straight because um we need to have and so we need you need to be compromised

and then you're under control um but you also get ahead completely makes sense completely makes sense in the way to do

that with especially the all these politicians who are essentially like Bad actors a lot of them they're just people

that want power and people that want control a lot of them and you know those kind of guys they want a party you know I mean that has been you've got two

types of uh leaders that are presidents you got [ __ ] hounds and warmongers you know and you know some of sometimes you

have both but generally you don't you guys like Clinton and JFK were anti-war and then you have guys like uh Bush who

you don't think of at all as a [ __ ] Hound but most certainly you think of as a warmonger hm do you what what um what

do you do you have a theory on what was Bill Gates's complicity with Epstein I think he likes

[ __ ] I think I think he's a man I think he likes power he likes Monopoly I mean

he's incredibly effective with Microsoft and for the longest time he was thought of as a villain right he was this

antitrust villain he was this guy who was monopolizing this operating system

and and and controlling just this incredible Empire

and he had a real bad rap and then I think he wisely turned towards

philanthropy and uh but do you do you do you think do you think that he needed

Epstein I think it's very difficult a very famous very high-profile person to [ __ ] around I think it's very difficult

I think you have to worry about people telling people you worry about it taking you down if you're having Affairs if you're running some pH philanthropy

organization you're supposed to be thought of as this guy who's like this one wonderful person who's trying to really fix all the problems in the world but really he just flying around and and

banging all these different chicks you have to figure out a way to pull that off and this is what uh Eric Weinstein

and I we've had discussions about this and Eric's position is that there are

people in this world that can provide experiences for you and safely for

people that are in that kind of a group and that makes sense it makes sense that if you pay people enough and you have

people motivated in order to like establish these relationships and make sure that these things happen when you get very high-profile you can't just be

on a [ __ ] dating app and if you're a guy who likes to bank checks what are you going to do I the um all of that

might be true but I I I wonder if there are more straightforward alternate conspiracy theories on Epstein that

we're missing so let me do let me do alternate one on Bill Gates where um the

um you know the things just just looking

at what's hiding in plain sight um you

know he supposedly um talked to um Epstein early on about um how his

marriage wasn't doing that well and then Epstein suggested that he should get a

divorce Circa 2010 2011 and Gates told

him something like um you know um uh that doesn't quite work um didn't have

presumably because he didn't have a prenup so um so there's one part of Epstein as a marriage counselor which is

sort of disturbing um but then um the second

thing that we know that um that Gates talked to to Epstein about was um sort

of uh you know all the sort of collaborating on funding setting up this

philanthropy all this sort of this um somewhat corrupt left-wing philanthropy structures and so there's a question you

know um um does and then and then my sort of

straightforward alternate conspiracy

theory is um should we ask um should we

ask should we combine those two and uh was there was there you know and I I

don't have all the details in this figured out but it would be something like you know um Bill and Melinda get

married in 1994 they don't sign a prup um and you know something's going wrong

with the marriage and maybe Melinda can get half the money in a in a divorce he

doesn't want her to get half the money what do you do and um uh and then the

alternate plan is something like um you

set up you set up uh you commit the

marital assets to this nonprofit and um and then it it sort of

locks Melinda into not complaining about the marriage for a long long time and

it's and and it's it's some kind of a um

and and so there's something about the left-wing philanthropy world that was uh

it was sort of some sort of Boomer way to control their crazy wives or something like

this it's also an effective way to whiteash your your past right your thought there all these and he he talked

to Epstein about he got Epstein to meet with the uh the head of the Nobel Prize foundation so it was um yeah Bill Gates

wanted to get a Nobel Nobel Prize wow right so this is all this is all yeah

this is all straightforward this is all known yeah and and and I'm not saying what you're saying about do you know the

history of the Nobel Prize that's the ultimate whitewash sure it was preventing Dynamite yeah that's the he

was he well Peter Berg told me the story I was blown away he originally um they

act someone said that he died and it was printed that he died but he didn't die and in the stories they were calling him The Merchant of death cuz he was the guy

that invented dynamite and he re realized that oh my God I this is my reputation this is how think people think about me I have to do something to

turn this around so he invented the Nobel Prize and he started then now the

the name Nobel is automatically connected in most people's eyes to the the greatest people amongst us the

people that have contributed the most to society and science and art and peace and all these different things Nobel Prize for medicine

the guy who invented super crazy history yeah it's a crazy history but it's the ultimate whitewash it's the same thing

like he came up with that prize because he wanted to change his image

publicly and um so it's ironic that Bill Gates would want to get a Nobel Prize um or not iron or ironic but understandable

and ironic but but I think but then if we if we uh if and so

there's yeah so there's there's underage sex version of the Epstein

story and then there is a crazy status Nobel Prize history of it and there is a

corrupt leftwing philanthropy one and there is a uh Boomers who didn't sign um

prenuptual agreements with their their wives story right and um and and I think

all those are worth exploring more I think you're right what is what about

the these leftwing philanthropy Ventures do you think is uniquely

corrupt

um sorry which one do I think is most

corrupt or what what about them these

when when you said corrupt yeah well um

man it's it's there's something about it's maybe it's just my

hermeneutic of Suspicion but there's something about you know there's

something about the virtue signaling and what does it mean and I always think

this is sort of a Europe America versus Europe difference where in um America

we're told that um um that philanthropy is something a

good person does and um you know if you're a Rockefeller or and you start

giving away all your money um this is just this is just what um a good person does and it shows how good you

are and then I think sort of the European intuition on it is something

like um you know wow um that's it's only something a very evil person does and if

you if you start giving away all your money in Europe it's like Joe you must have murdered somebody or you must you must be covered up for something so

there these two very different intuitions and I think I think the

European one is more correct than the American one and uh probably there's

some history where um you know the sort of left-wing philanthropy peaked in 2007

2010 2012 and there's these subtle ways you

know we've um we've become you know we've become more you know more more um

more European in our sensibilities as a society and so it has this very

different veence from what it did uh 12 or 14 years ago but yeah it's all we we

ask all these questions like we're asking right now about Bill Gates where it's like okay he was you know it was like all the testimony in the Microsoft

antitrust trial in the 90s where he's like he's cutting off the air supply he wants to strangle people and he's like

not he's kind of a sociopathic guy it seems and then it's it's it's this giant whitewashing operation and and then

somehow the whitewashing has been made too transparent and uh it gets deconstructed and exposed by you know

the internet or whatever but I think most people are still unaware of how much whitewashing actually took place including donating somewhere in the

neighborhood of 300 plus million dollars to Media corporations essentially buying

favorable uh reviews about him and then there's this very public philanthropy it's not just philanthropy it's

philanthropy mixed with public relations public Rel um relations because he's constantly doing interviews about it

this is not like a guy who is just silently donating his incredible wealth to all these causes he's advocating for

it on various talk shows he's constantly talking about it and how we need to do things I mean during the pandemic he was

a very vocal voice he was the guy telling us he was a somehow or another he became a public health expert and no

one questioned why we were taking Public Health advice from some someone who has

a financial interest in this one very particular remedy yeah or

um yeah there all these alternate versions I can give but yeah I I think

um I think uh it's so it's always so hard to know

what's really going on in our culture though so I I think I think all what you

say is true but I also think it's not working as well as it used to Ag and

there's a way people see through this it's not always as articulate as you

just articulated it but there's there's

some there's some vague intuition that um you know um you know when Mr Gates is

just wearing uh sweaters and looks like Mr Rogers that something fishy is going on people people have that sort of in trust Jeff Bezos in his tight shirt

hanging out with his girlfriend on the yach or Elon Elon Musk uh the vice signaling is safer than virtue signaling

yeah right because if you're you know if your virtue signaling are intuition is

something really really really sketchy suspicious we get suspicious and I think rightly so I think especially when

someone's doing something so public I think rightly we should be suspicious especially when I mean with with Gates it's like you know the history of the

guy I mean you know what he was involved with before you know how he ran Microsoft you know it just kind of makes

sense that it's a clever movie move it's a clever move to pay the media it's a clever move again my my my my alternate

one which is not incompatible with yours on on on Gates is that uh um Melinda

finally files for divorce in early

21 um I think she told Bill she wanted

one late 2019 so 2020 the year where um

he Bill Gates goes into overdrive on covid um you know um all this stuff you

know part part of it maybe it's self-dealing and he's trying to make money from the drug company or something

like this but um you know

isn't isn't the other really big thing he needs to box Melinda in and force her

not to get that much out because all the money's going to the foundation anyway

Melinda has to say um you know um I want why do you want half the money it's all

going to the Gates Foundation anyway we're not leaving our kids anything and

um and then when you lean into Co you know how does that work in the you know

it's somehow um in theory Melinda has a really strong hand she should get half

that's what you get in a divorce with um no prenuptial but then if you make it go

overdrive on Co Melinda are you a you

know are you a I don't know

uh are you like some crazy anti-science

person right and um and so so I don't

know my my my my my my reconstruction is

that uh you should not underestimate how much of it was you know about just controlling his ex-wife and and not

about controlling the whole society makes sense it makes sense you they can both be they can both be

correct sure there there's many factors but mine mine lines up really well with the with the timeline well we're probably talking about a hundred million

doll or hundred billion dollars one way or the other well I think she got got she got less than she got like one tenth

really interesting and she should have gotten half as far as and I it's amazing he got it down that much WoW interesting

but it was just I think she was just boxed in every time he went on TV talking about Co she was boxed in with

all of her leftwing friends that is an interesting philosophy that's an interesting way to

approach a problem if you're him very wise you know very clever I mean if you're just looking at like

just for personal benefit the genius move and the guy's a genius clearly brilliant guy you know I mean that makes

sense makes sense that he would do that I don't know you know I would do that probably should have had a prup but

yeah yeah well that's kind of crazy that's interesting that yeah I didn't consider that but it makes sense and

she's you know she's been kind of pretty vocal unfortunately for him about his ties to Epstein being one of the primary

reasons why she wanted out but again my Al again it's what did he was he was

he was he having extramarital Affairs through Epstein or maybe Epstein was from Melinda's point of view would it be

worse for Epstein to facilitate an extramarital affair or would it be worse

for Epstein to be advising Gates on how to how to ditch Melinda without giving her any money what do you think he was

that would be much much worse from a Linda's point of view yeah makes sense it totally makes sense do you think that he was a legitimate finan adviser like

he could give him advice on how to do those things that Gates wouldn't have more effective people I mean he's when

you're at that level of wealth I'm sure you have wealth management people that are like very high level

um because that's one of the things that Eric said about him he said when he met him he's like this guy's a fraud like this he doesn't know enough about what

he's talking about and you know Eric is you know I I I met Epstein

a a few times as well and I think how'd you get introduced um it was uh it was

Reed Hoffman and Silicon Valley introduced us in 2014 but um but it was

it was basically uh and I I you know I didn't

didn't uh check didn't ask any enough questions about it

um but I yeah I I think there were sort of a lot of things where it was was

fraudulent I do think Epstein knew a lot about taxes and um and there were probably you

know these these complicated ways you could um you could

structure a nonprofit organization especially as a way in in a

in a marital cont context that uh that I I think Epstein might have might have known a decent amount about how when you

were introduced to him I don't I don't think Epstein would have been able to um

you know comment on super String Theory something like that but uh but I think I think this sort of thing he he might

have actually been pretty expert on when you were introduced to him what how was he described to you um he was described

as uh one of the smartest tax people in the world interesting and uh and I I probably probably was my moral weakness

that I how could you have known back then he had never been arrested no this was this was post 2014 was post arrest

oh so his arrest was the first arrest right which was like 200 78 okay okay

and so but you know you you assume um he didn't go to jail for that long right it was probably not not as serious as

alleged uh there was was certainly was the illusion that there were all these these other people that I trusted you

know Reed who introduced us was you know he started LinkedIn he was you know

maybe too focused on business Network working but but uh but I thought he always had good judgment in people when the [ __ ] went down and epine gets

arrested for the second time were you like oh well there you go

uh I've thought about it I thought a lot about it as a result yeah yeah I'm sure Jesus Christ well he tricked a lot of

people I know a lot of people that met that guy he got a lot of celebrities to come

to his house for parties and things well I think I think it was it's it was it's a

I think a lot of it was this was this strange commentary on you know I know it

was some secret Club secret society you could be part of right of course again that wasn't it wasn't explicit but that

was that was the vague vague Vibe of the whole thing people love those stupid things they love like exclusive clubs

that very few people look at the [ __ ] Soho House like look at that stupid thing I mean you just go to a place that you have to be a member to go to and

everybody wants to be a member oh my God got get and then you got like the Malibu Soho house it's different from the other

ones you have to have membership only there do you have membership there people love that kind of [ __ ] socially

they love being a part of a Walled Garden they love it they love it and if you're a guy like Bill Gates or or or

similarly wealthy you probably have a very small amount of people that you can relate to very small amount of people that you can trust probably very

difficult to form new friendships yeah I I I think there were probably different different things that were pitched for different people sure

you know I I was I was pitched on the taxes I think you know there were

probably other people that were you know more um more prone to the you know um the Social Club part and then there were

probably people yeah and there was probably a fairly limited group where it was uh yeah off off the charts bad

wouldn't it be wonderful to know what the [ __ ] was really going on and maybe one day we will maybe one day some Whitney web type character will break it

all down to us and explain do us in great detail exactly how this was formulated and what they were doing and how they were getting information out of

people but I think people have to age out they have to they have to die and we we still don't have it on the Kennedy assassination JFK crazy well one of the

wildest Things That Trump said was that if they told you what they told me you wouldn't tell people

either which is like what the [ __ ] does that mean what does that mean I don't

think legally he can tell you right because I think those things are Above Top Secret if if they did inform him of

something there must be some sort of prerequisite to keeping this a

secret I I I haven't studied that one that carefully but

isn't you know there all these alternate conspiracy theories on who killed JFK

it's you know the CIA and the mafia and the Russians and the Cubans and um you

know um there's an LBJ version since he's the one who benefited so all these

happened in Texas um uh you have all these you know

alternate theories and on some level it's it's it's yeah it's it's I always think it's just a commentary where you

know 1963 America wasn't it wasn't like Leave it to Beaver it was it was like a really crazy country underneath the

surface and absolutely um and even though probably most of the conspiracy theories are wrong it was like murder on

the oran Express and all these people sort of had different reasons for wanting Kennedy dead and that's that's what the theories are right even if

they're wrong on the level of factual detail and then the the the sort of more

minimal one that I'm I'm open to and I think there's some evidence in this from

from the stuff that has been that has uh

come out is you know Oswald was talking

to you know parts of the US deep State and so even if Oswald was the Lan assassin and you somehow get the magic

bullet theory and all that stuff to work but let's say Oswald was the loan ass pass did did he did he tell someone in

the FBI or CIA you know I'm going to I'm going to go kill Kennedy tomorrow and then you know maybe maybe the CIA didn't

have to kill him they just didn't had to do nothing just had a sit on it or or maybe was too incompetent and didn't get

you know didn't go up the bureaucracy and so it's you know I I think we sort

of know that they they talked to Oswald you know a fair amount before

before it happened and uh and so there's at least something you know that was

grossly incompetent I think people have a problem minimum with with two stories being mut mutually exclusive two stories

being the lone gunman or the CIA killed Kennedy and then they these they're not connected I think Lee Harvey Oswell was

a part of it I think I think he probably did shoot that cop there's some evidence that you when when he was on the run and

he was confronted you know there was a cop that that got shot and were alleging he he he might have done it he might have taken a shot at Kennedy he might

have even hit him I don't think he was the only one shooting I I think the the

vast there was an enormous amount of people that heard sounds coming from the grassy null they heard gunfire they

reportedly saw people the amount of people that were witnesses to the Kennedy assassination that died

mysterious deaths is pretty shocking um Jack Ruby Well Jack Ruby just that's a

weird one right Oswald yeah Jack Ruby walks up to Oswald shoots him and then Jack Ruby with no previous history of

mental illness becomes completely insane after getting visited by Jolly West which is nuts like why is the guy who's

the head of MK Ultra visiting the guy who shot the Assassin of the president and why is he left alone with them what

what happens what does he give him that this guy is screaming out they're burning Jews alive and just crazy crazy

[ __ ] he was yelling out he went nuts probably some some amount of usty that dangerous enormous amount they probably

gave him a [ __ ] glass of it they probably gave him a glass of it and told him it was water drink this and who

[ __ ] knows but the point is I think I think it's very possible

that Oswald was a part of it and the way they did it and the way they just shot

Oswald and and then they write the warrant commission we don't even see the

zuder film until 12 years later when haraldo Rivera and when they play it on television when

um Dick Gregory brought it to Heraldo Rivera which is wild a comedian brings the video the the the actual film rather

of the assassination from a different angle well you can actually see the video of him getting shot and his his head snaps back and to the left and

everybody's like what the [ __ ] is going on here um when you look at all that

stuff this mirrors what happened with this Crooks kid this Crooks kid somehow

or another gets to the top of the roof is spotted by these people they know he's there they know he has a rifle they

see him walking around the crime scene half an hour before with a

rangefinder the the whole thing is bananas and then they go to his house after he's killed it's completely

scrubbed there's no silverware there they know that there's ad data that

shows that a phone that's coming from the FBI offices in DC had visited him on multiple occasions cuz they tracked ad

data there's and if that guy if he shot Trump and Trump got murdered and then they

shot him it would be the Kennedy assassination all over again everybody would going what the [ __ ] happened what

happened what was the motivation what was he on any drugs what's the toxicology report how did he get up

there who knew he was up there how how did they not shoot him quicker like what the [ __ ] happened how was he able to get

off three shots what happened and go I I think there's like a slightly less crazy

that might still be true which is just that uh people in the Secret Service in

the um Biden Administration don't like Trump and it's they didn't have full intention to kill him but it's just they

didn't protect him we're just we're just you know we're going to have we're going to underst staff it we're um we're not

going to we don't have to do as good a job coordinating with the local police there's all these ways you know um to make someone less safe you know but it

seems more than that if they if they knew that the guy was on the roof with a rifle that seems a little more than that it's always a question who they is

though right well if I'm a sniper and I'm on people people in the audience people there were people there tell telling it to people right but I think

the authorities knew this guy was on the roof before as well um well I I I I

suspect some of the Secret Service people were were told that and then who

knows how that got relayed or who all snipers already have eye on him I believe the snipers already had eye on I

I don't know find out if that's true Jamie find out the snipers had eye on SEC service I don't know about the

snipers I I I I I don't I don't know about uh the the thing I don't have a

good sense on with uh with with with shooting and maybe maybe you'd have a

better feel for this is my my senses was a pretty straightforward shot for for

the guy in um the Trump assassin would be assassin I think the Oswalt shot was

a much harder one because Kennedy's moving yes and no yes and no okay

because uh Oswald had a scope so Oswald had a rifle the marono rifle say one of

the snipers stationed inside the building reported first saw Crooks outside and looking up to the roof of the building before the suspect left the scene crook Slater came back and sat

down while looking at his phone near the building CBS News reported that a sniper took a photo of the suspect when he returned but I think they saw him on the

roof though um krooks then took out a rang finder like right then arrest that guy you got

a [ __ ] Rangefinder about the suspect's action Crooks then disappeared again and returned to the building with

a backpack again arrest him Secret Service snipers again alerted their command post about Crook's actions

according to the source who spoke with CBS News Crooks had already climbed to the top of the building in question by the time the additional officers arrived

at the scene for backup the suspect also positioned himself above and behind the snipers inside the building by the time

the police started rushing the scene and other officers attempted to get onto the roof the source told CBS news that a different Secret Service sniper had

killed Crooks okay so it seems like they they [ __ ] bumbled it at every step of the way if they knew that guy was there if

they knew he had a rangef finder returns to the backpack he gets onto the roof all that's insane that is at the very

least horrific incompetence at the very least let me go back yeah okay but back

to Mike was it I I thought it was a much easier shot for it's not an easy head shot um he's shooting at his head but why why why why was shooting at the head

the right thing shouldn't you be shooting at well you don't know if he wearing a vest right um he could be wearing a vest which you would have to

have plates you'd have to have uh ceramic plates in order to stop a a a

rifle round so was was it a 308 what what did he have what kind of rifle did

he have I have never seen that I think he had an AR-15 so and are are the

Scopes a lot better today than he have we're pretty sure how good was Oswell scope it was good they said it was off

this was one of the the conspiracy theories uh oh the scope was off but that doesn't mean anything because Scopes can get off when you pick it up

if you knock it against the wall when he drops it if you makes the shot and then drops the scope and the scope hits the

window sill and then bounces off that's excuse me that Scopes off anytime you knock is there anything about the high

angle from Oswald made it harder no not a difficult shot very difficult to get off three shots very quickly so that was the thing that they had attributed three

shots to Oswald the reason why they had attributed three shots is because one of them had hit a Ricochet one of them had gone into the underpass ricocheted off

the curb and hit a man who was treated at a hospital they found that they found out where had hit the bulleted hit so they knew that one bullet Miss Kennedy

hit that curb which would have indicated that someone shot from a similar

position as Lee Harvey Oswell um so then they had the one wound that uh Kennedy

had to the head of course and then they had another wound that Kennedy had uh through his neck that's the magic bullet theory this is why they had to come up

with the magic bullet theory cuz they had tribute all these wounds to one bullet then they find this pristine

bullet they find it in the gurnie when they're bringing uh Governor Connelly in

nonsense it's total nonsense the bullet is undeformed a bullet that goes through

two people and leaves more fragments of the bullet in connell's wrist that are missing from the bullet itself and then

the bullets not deformed after shattering bone all that's crazy all that defies logic that doesn't make any

sense if you know anything about bullets and if you shoot bullets into things they distort it's just one of the things that happen um that bullet looks like

someone shot it into a swimming pool that's what it looks like when they would do ballistics on on bullets and they try to figure out like if it was

this guy's gun or that guy's gun and by the rifling of the round they can get similar markings on bullets when they do that that's how they do it they do it so

the Bullet doesn't distort so they shoot that bullet into uh water or something like that now that bullet was uh metal

jacketed right if you look at the bullet the top of it is uh [ __ ] up and but the the shape of the bullet looks pretty

perfect it doesn't look like something that shattered bones and then you have to attribute you have to account rather

for the amount of per there's little fragments of the bullet that you could see that they found in connell's wrist

the whole thing's nuts the whole thing's nuts that you're only saying that this one guy did it because that's convenient

and the Warren commission's the Warren Commission whitewashed everything so the whole thing's nuts it's much more likely that there were people in the grassy

null and then the umbrellas as the pointers or whatever I mean I don't know I don't know about what all I know is

you got a guy in a convertible which is [ __ ] crazy who is the president of the United States and he's going slowly

down a road now if you are in a prone position so Oswald is uh on the window sill right which is a great place to

shoot by the way it's a great place to shoot cuz you rest that gun on the window sill and if you rest it on the window sill there's no movement right so

you wrap your arm around the sling if it had a sling I'm not sure if it did so you get a nice tight grip you shove it

up against your shoulder you rest it on the window sill and all you have to do is you have a round already racked all

and you have a scope and so the scope's magnified all you have to do is wait until he's there you lead him just a

little bit and squeeze one off and then boom boom

you could do that pretty quick it's not outside of the realm of possibility that

he did get off three shots what doesn't make sense is the backing to the left it doesn't make sense that all these other

people saw people shooting from the grassy null there's all these people that saw people running away they saw

smoke there's smoke in some photographs of it it looks like there was more than one shooter and it looks like they tried to they tried to hide that they tried to

hide that in the warrant commission report the shot to Kennedy's neck initially was in when they brought him

in in Dallas when he was before they shipped him to Bethesda they said that that was an entry wound when he got to

Bethesda then it became a tracheotomy why do you give a tracheotomy to a guy who doesn't have a head you don't I mean

that just none of it makes any sense they altered the autopsy this is a part of David lon's book best evidence um

Kennedy's brain wasn't even in his body when they buried him like the the the whole thing is very strange but then do

do you get to anything more concrete than my murder on the orian express where they're just you know it could have been a lot of people could the

Russians the Cubans the well no one even got suspicious for 12

years I think people were susp a lot of people suspicious kind of but what do you have to go on you don't have to go on anything like this Crooks kid we

don't have anything to go on we're just going to be left out here just like we're left out here with the the Epstein

information no one knows the people that whoever organized it if anyone did you're never going to hear about it it's just going to go away the news Cycle's

just going to keep flooded with more nonsense and and I think there's probably a bunch of people that wanted Kennedy dead I think there was more than

one group of people that wanted Kennedy dead I think there's probably collusion between groups that wanted Kennedy dead and I think there's a lot of people that have vested interest in ending his

presidency and I think he was dangerous he was dangerous to a lot of the powers it be he was dangerous his his famous

speech about secret societies crazy speech guy has this speech and then gets murdered right afterwards kind of nuts

like the whole thing's nuts he wanted to get rid of the CIA he wanted to I mean there was so many things that Kennedy

wanted to do there were also a lot of crazy things Kennedy was doing you know so you know the um the the Cuba version

of the assassination theory was um you know we had the Cuban Missile Crisis in 62 about a year earlier and then the

deal that we struck with the Soviets was um you know um they take the missiles

out of Cuba and we promised we wouldn't um we wouldn't try to overthrow the

government in Cuba and uh and I guess we

you know we no longer did um you know we no longer did Bay of Pigs type covert stuff like that but I think there were

still something like four or five assassination plots on Fidel yeah attempts actual attempts and then I think there was I don't know I think

that again I'm going to get this garbled I think a month or two before the JFK assassination it

castra said something like you know um there might be repercussions if you keep doing this yeah well listen I'm sure there's a lot of people that wanted that

guy dead and I'm sure they would coordinate I mean if you knew that Cuba wanted Kennedy dead and you knew that

Cuba can get you assassins or that they could help in in any way you I'm sure they would want as many people that knew

for a fact they wanted him dead and had communicated that I mean back then they were doing wild [ __ ] man I mean this is

when they were doing operation Northwood this again where I think I think I think it

is I don't think we're in a world where zero stuff is happening I I still I

still uh the place where I directionally have a different feel for it is I think

um so much less of the stuff is going on and it's it's so much harder in this internet world for people to hide with

whistleblowers as well and their legacy programs and there are internal records that are being kept and um you know like

I I I don't know this for sure but I think even the NSA fisa court stuff which was an outof control deep State

thing that was going on through about 2016 2017 I suspect even that at this

point you know can't quite work because people know that they're being watched

they know they're being recorded and it's it's just you know you know you can't do water boarding in Guantanamo if

you have lawyers running all over the place correct and that's I hope you're correct but it brings me back to this

whole idea of getting dirt then I think I think there's and then on the other

hand there's also um you know a degree

to which um our government our our deep

State um across the board is shockingly less competent less functional and um

it's less capable of this and this is this is where I'm not even sure whether this is an improvement you know right so

it's it's sort of like um you know um maybe um the

1963 us where let's go with the craziest version where our deep state is capable

of knocking off the president maybe that's actually a higher functioning

Society than uh than the uh than um the crazy version where they are they're

incapable of doing it right and they're bogged down with Dei they can't they they can't they can't get the gunman even to have a scope on his rifle or

whatever yeah I don't we we haven't really totally figured out had scope on his rifle but I don't believe he did man

it's like it's like much bigger loser can you find someone as competent as Oswalt right or something like that you

know yeah it's a good point it's a good point and so I I um I I I'm I I Veer

more to the explanation that it's uh it's gross incompetence but I I don't

know if that makes it better it might make it worse I think they weren't as competent right because they only had

one guy doing it and he wasn't effective if you had the same if if you had much

better organization you wouldn't have it just one guy I mean there's people out there that I know that can kill someone

from a mile away but it's it it's it's very effective you you can you can do things as a solo actor it's it's hard to

organize because everything gets recorded everything does get recorded that is a fact but it brings me back to that thing about having dirt on people

that you were talking about with why the Epstein information doesn't get released and why they probably did it in the first place they did it in the first place you have dirt on people then you

know those people are not going to tell on you you all coordinate together that is that is still a that is still a strange Counterpoint to my thesis where

why has the dirt not come out and so somehow there's some some way uh the container is still kind of working yeah

it's kind of working it's just everyone is aware that it's working and then they frustrated that nothing happens you know like Julian Assange being arrested and

and spending so much time locked up in the embassy like finally recently released but didn't he have to delete like a bunch of emails in order to be

released but you know the you know in the in the but again just just to take the other side of this both in the

Assange Snowden stuff um yeah it showed an outof control deep state that was

just hoovering up all the data in the world right and then um but we weren't

like it didn't show like James Bond times 100 there W weren't like exploding

cigar assassination plots there was none

of we're doing so little with this is is

um seems they don't or at least that's

the um but you know it's I I think it's there's so much less agency in the CIA

in the Central Intelligence Agency it's so much less agentic I hope you're right again I I don't know incorrect with how

they deal with overseas stuff I hope they're really good at that um you know that brings me to this whole UAP thing

because one of my primary theories about the UAP thing is it's stuff that we have I think I think that's a lot of what

people are seeing I think I think there's secret programs um that are

Beyond congressional oversight that have done some things with propulsion that's

outside of our understanding our our current the conventional understanding that most people have about rockets and all these different things being the

only way to propel things through the sky I think they figured out some other stuff and I think they're drones and I think they have drones that can use some

sort of whether it's anti-gravity propulsion system or some you know so do you that's that's your that's your

placeholder Theory or that's that's uh that's what you think more than space aliens or do you think both space aliens

and that or which which version of this the ladder I think both you think both yeah I don't I don't think we haven't been visited I think we have I I think

we if if life exists elsewhere where it most certainly should it just makes sense but do you do you do you think um

do you think the UFO sightings from the 50s and 60s were already drone programs were they already that Advance no those are the ones that give me pause um

that's why you know when I named my comedy club The Comedy Mothership it's all UFO themed our our rooms are named

fat man and little boy our rooms are named after the nuclear bombs because those nuclear bombs when they drop them that's when everybody starts seeing

these things and I think if I was a sophisticated Society from another planet and I recognized that there is an intelligent species that has developed

nuclear power and has started using it as bombs I would immediately start visiting and I would let them know hey [ __ ] like there's there's

something way more advanced than you I would hover over the nuclear bases and shut down their missiles I would do all the things that supposedly the UFOs did

just to keep the government in check just to say Hey you are going through a transitionary period that all

intelligent species do when they have the ability to harness incredible power and yet they still have these Prime

primape brains they they have these territorial ape brains but yet now with

the ability to literally harness the power of stars and drop them on cities I think that's when I would start visiting

and I think all throughout human history before that even there's been very

bizarre accounts of these things all the way back to Ezekiel in the Bible very bizarre accounts of these things that

are flying through space Chariot yeah there's there's a bunch of them there's the vimanas and the ancient Hindu text

there's there's so many of these things that you got to wonder and you got to think that if we send drones to Mars and
