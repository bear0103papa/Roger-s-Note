um we will have used up all of our highquality text and data which will

slow down ai's progress so companies are inventing new devices to sell to us so

they can get more data in the problem is that most of the training data that

we're using to train AI is Online Wikipedia Reddit books spreadsheets

right stuff like that so AI can't actually interact with us with real

people normal real people while it's learning we have not yet created an in

silico model of the real world so we don't just need more data going forward

we need more types of data which means that large language

models aren't enough plus it's a lot harder to get that information because everybody's starting to sue the kind of

data that we need going forward are sensor data visual data things like that

so what's coming after large language

models are large action models llms

predict what to say next LS predict what

to do next breaking down complex tasks into smaller pieces that's why we are

about to be surrounded by millions of sensors that are always on also always

on us they are around us and they can collect multiple streams of data at once

so the second general purpose technology this other layer of the tech super cycle has to do with the constellation of

wearables extended reality devices The Internet of Things the home of things Smart Cars Smart offices smart

Apartments sensors everywhere I call this connectables this

is the network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data to

facilitate and fuel the advancement of artificial

intelligence we are about to see a Cambrian explosion of devices and at the

beginning a lot of them are going to be pretty weird like this AI powered cat

door um it uses cameras and sensors to

keep your cat outside until it drops the dead animal present it it made for you

so unless it drops the dead thing uh it

will not allow the animal back into your

house this is weird I hope you think uh

I don't know cat people are your own species of people um but this is not the

first time in history when we have seen weird technology I ask you to remember

the taser the taser the company that

makes a stun gun uh made this delightful

combo unit it's an MP3 player stun gun holster so I guess while you're tasering

some horrible person you can listen to Seline Deon or whatever your jam is yes

for the next few years you're going to see a lot of bizarre devices that nobody wants or needs until there's a

normalization and we wind up with a sweet of gear that we're actually going to wind up using every day and at that

point the foundational layer of the tech super cycle will have faded into the

background and just emerge ambiently when you need it which is why there's a rush right now to create AI first

devices they're meant to continuously learn from you in real time MIT IBM

Watson and some others they came up with a way to process data that isn't text so they came up with a way to to create a

large action model to use sensor data that's connected uh connected to a device that you would just have on you

all the time in your pocket so it's kind of like having your own little you know personal neural network a little tiny

brain in your pocket which is the the promise of this thing so this is the rabbit one which is the beginning of

large action models out in the real world basically this thing is like a walkie-talkie with a screen except that

on the other side of it isn't a human it's an AI you hold down a button and you ask it to do something play a

Spotify song Tell me the weather and it will complete that action for you on your phone it also has a training mode

so the more that you use it the more that it learns about you so in a way this thing is creating a large action

model that's very tailored to you and I don't know if this is exactly what the future is going to look like but it

shows us that the future looks very different than the present does today but there is a connectable device that

you're already familiar with and it's this one you are going to start to see face computers everywhere this year this

particular face computer comes from Apple it's the Vision Pro now we love and we hate

and we love to hate this device and maybe it'll turn out that the

Vision Pro is a lot like the original iPhone which is to say the OG iPhone was

janky and uh it didn't really have a developer or an app ecosystem ready but it went through a whole bunch of

iterations and became the predominant you know device that we we all now use

so you might have to imagine a Vision Pro 18 iterations from now kind of like

the iPhone either way it doesn't matter because it's already started to

accelerate um the advancement of XR devices overall Google Samsung Qualcomm

they have a partnership to develop a real extended reality device on Android meta has its device in market and I

think yesterday there was a big brewhaha on one of the platforms with Zuckerberg saying no no no Oculus is awesome um

snap you know has its platform so these things are everywhere now you might wonder wonder why am I insisting on

calling this thing a face computer and the answer is because it is a computer

that you are strapping to your face in fact you have no idea what it is that

you are there's like one person in the back that just kind of went um what you're what you're

strapping onto your face The Vision Pro has 14 cameras that capture all different types of details in and out of

the headset lar sensors that use light to measure distance and create a 3D map around you infrared cameras

accelerometers gyroscopes all the stuff and they feed all of that information

into a multi-dimensional space a spatial Computing environment the other devices

the other face computers that are coming to Market this year they're also all

going to have a ton of sensors now face computers are being designed from your point of view to help you interact with

the world differently from my point of view they're being designed for other purposes as well they are being designed

to read your intentions they can do that in part by reading and predicting the move movement

of your pupil so my husband Brian is an eye doctor uh so I've got the inside scoop on this but basically when you

think about something your pupil starts reacting so if you get excited it

changes sizes you have no control over this it is completely automatic um which

means that your eye is going to move

even before potentially you are aware of the thought you're about to have okay

yeah now you know why we're talking about this your pupil will move

sometimes before your your body does okay which means that your face computer

will know what you are going to do what

you are about to think even before you do face computers are very expensive

right now so they're Out Of Reach of most people but that's going to change and companies are highly

motivated to build large action models and to get more types of data in so what's eventually coming is a battle for

face Supremacy companies vying to get you to wear their Hardware another connectible an enormous Innovation

that's coming to Market next month is from a company called Humane it's basically a brooch uh a lot of people

are very skeptical of this thing it's pin um and before you compare this to

the next taser MP3 player combo Unit C thing I actually think that this could

represent a fundamental shift in how we use technology so it's got a camera and

a phone and a projector it collects data all day long and it also serves as an

interface for your everyday life it effectively builds a large action model

about you now look I don't think there's a massive conspiracy here I don't think

that the Tech Titans are in a war room somewhere planning their face Supremacy you know

domination I just think this is maybe the next stage of capitalism as the tech

super cycle starts to really power up we've incentivized these companies to get their Market uh their products into

Market as soon as possible and there is no prize there's no reward for the

company with the most secure most privacy assured device the market

doesn't reward preemptive problems solving companies make money through cycle upgrades and through services so

to grow Revenue they're going to keep making newer better devices that you will pay for and they're going to get you to pay for services whether that's

access to content or access to your large action model whatever it may be um you make the money as a company by

getting to Supremacy with the dominant brand and the dominant devices to the maximum number of people I only had time

to show you two devices there are lots andot Lots coming for your body for your office open AI supposedly has a device

in development for your home so keep an eye on this space and also flip through the tech Trends report because we

explain a lot of them all the way throughout this is really just the very beginning second set of scenarios so

again this is going to build on artificial intelligence and now includes connectables so let's combine what we

know with the things that we cannot know to see where we

get what if you got instant summaries

and Analysis of anything anytime you wanted let's say you work in insurance

and after listening to this presentation this morning you're like huh all that stuff about large action models that is

going to make a hugee impact on my industry so I should probably take everything she just said put it into a

PowerPoint and like run it up the chain and and tell everybody else in my company right because these would be

really really good notes uh to share

and maybe you're highly offended by 20 early 2000s fashion trends and so maybe

uh your AI system would just automatically omit that part from my speech and just create the PowerPoint

Deck with every all the good stuff right uh and that would be great in this scenario about an hour from now you

would have an automatic summary generated from this presentation of everything that matters to your company

in Insurance you would hit a button have it automat atically make a PowerPoint hit another button and automatically

send it to your boss that is days worth of work that you will have done in an

instant and now you get to go to the bar and drink extra

Margaritas you're the hero

right but I hate to ask this what

happens when and it is when not if your large action model hallucinates Hallucination is something we talk a lot

about out when it comes to large language models right hallucinating is when you get nonsensical images

nonsensical words thoughts things like

that so what if your large action model

hallucinates and it makes a PowerPoint that randomly includes Nazis since today

I mention Nazis and then throws in a tampon Bush for good

measure and automatically sends that to your boss instead well friends you are still drinking

margaritas here's another scenario what if connectables leads to social scoring so again let's assume that it's 5 to

seven years from now we're all wearing different devices and that you all have connectables devices in your home let's

say that there are now large action models that understand the world around

you your specific world as well in this future who might want want that data now assuming that you give consent this

could actually be a really good thing clothing manufacturers might know how actual bodies look and how they actually

move and they might change their sizes to represent what normal humans look like that would be a good thing right

schools might have real reliable models of how people spend their attention and how they learn so this could improve

education so there's a lot of good things that could come but I want to talk about Banks there are some researchers at the

Technical University of Denmark that built a brand new model that predicts when you will die using artificial

intelligence um now what's interesting is they built this without large action models it's probably not accurate

they're just using sort of generic information however if we think about all of the stuff that's coming to Market

if I'm a bank considering whether to give you a 30-year mortgage for a house that you want to buy it seems like I

might want to build build a large death model no something like like that might come in handy here's another fun

optimistic scenario what if we accidentally create an even worse digital divide think about your

groceries for a moment grocery stores and cpg companies today operate on razor thin margins and that is basically true

everywhere in the world so anything at all they can do to bump up their margins is really important so what if they use

Dynamic pricing this is where prices would change in real time time in response to a trigger what if in the

future there are no set prices for anything anymore instead you get personalized prices for everything that

you buy with the intention to get you to buy more things to optimize for when you are

likely to spend at that moment to nudge you to buy more stuff and what if

Dynamic pricing causes Panic buying and inflation which it will at scale what if

you can't afford your groceries anymore what if to afford your groceries you have to watch attention coupons you go

to the store and the dynamic prices are too high for let's say soup so you have

to stop you have to agree to share and upload your information your data with a

cpg company that makes the soup and watch a 30 second ad matched

specifically to your large action model and then you have to keep stopping because that was just soup and you have

a very long grocery list you have to keep watching ads and sharing data the entire way through that

you move through the store and by the way you are watching because our connectables are so powerful now they

know whether you're paying attention no attention no discount now if you're

affluent look if you're rich it just doesn't matter to you uh you just turn off the attention coupons and you have

total freedom of movement this is actually the worst part the worst first part is that when we talk about privacy

today we need to broaden how we're thinking about uh privacy because in this

future you know who's rich and who's poor by walking into the door of a grocery store because the rich people

move around and buy what they want anybody who's financially struggling has

to stand staring at the shelves waiting so they can afford the groceries they need to

buy let's talk about security and computer VIIs uses that'll be fun the the way that a computer virus malware

ransomware spreads is by a bad actor sending an attack somebody executing it

um so what if soon malware gets tied to our physical movement what if somebody

cracks your movement identity there is no possible feasible way to change it

it's not a password it is literally who you are what if hackers invent an exploit called surprise ball which is

when a bunch of people will see that you're wearing a face computer and it looks like somebody throws a ball at you

you you put your hand up to Flinch automatically and that unlocks malware it's a spatial Computing attack

specifically designed to get you into moving into an attacker defined location and it gets activated while you're

wearing your work face computer so here's your key Insight connectables

enable ubiquitous realtime data collection and AI training all right so we're at the end

data from connectables gives AI the data that it needs but as we advance all of these systems and platforms they're

becoming a lot more power hungry we have all heard about semiconductor chip shortages and challenges right there

were all kinds of problems there was problems in Taiwan problems in Japan so everybody wants AI now we have a

colossal problem on our hands going forward chips are very very hard to come by and we also know that Moore's Law is

starting to fail we're hitting limits so yes it may be possible to get smaller and smaller things onto chips it's also

getting more and more expensive so we need something new there are Rumblings about alternative architectures out

there there's this new thing called grock which is not the Elon Musk grock this is a different grock that would

allow GPT to run about 14 times faster than it does right now and it would be wonderful if all of these things start

to scale and whatever else really really quickly but the reality is we still need

the materials and for right now we're stuck now it may not seem like artificial intelligence and connectables

have much to do with biotechnology which is the third part of the tech super cycle but it does here's the connection

the reason that biology connects to Ai and connectables is because biology

processes information in a way that silicon can't in other words if we're

trying to build machines that can think and behave like we do we literally need

to make them more like us so as last year as much as last year was a big year for AI it was actually a much much

bigger year for biotech you just didn't hear a lot about that we're going to see a ton of activity in the space going forward there's an entire part of the

trend report that just has to do with biotech that I would encourage you to take a look through for our purposes

today two quick trends that are very very important the first has to do with

Materials Science last week a brand new AI model called Evo launched and it uses

the language of biology so that's DNA RNA and proteins to make predictions to

enable design uh from molecules to full genomes so it's kind of like chat GPT

but instead for organisms which means

that coming after generative AI is

generative biology that's what's coming so there's another company another startup you know how you write a prompt

into chat GPT you know to write your emails for you well you can do that with Biology now there's a startup uh that

will allow you to enter a prompt determine the size shape function whatever of the protein that you want

and then spits out the formula for it um

Deep Mind built an AI tool same basic

concept generative biology it found 2.2

million new materials 380,000 of them are now in a lab being developed that

could potentially power future Technologies so we can generate new

biology which means new Therapeutics new ways to manage climate change new ways

to deal with the global food shortage but the question that I would ask you is does this help our semiconductor chip

problem and that takes me to the to the

final Trend sometime in the next decade

AI will be working alongside oi I organoid intelligence so what's an

organoid it's basically a tiny replica of tissue that functions and is

structured like the organ um so basically scientists start with a special type of stem cell you can think

of it as a blank they put them in a gelatinous mixture they start adding

molecules to nudge it to become that type of whatever it is uh heart cells

brain cells whatever and then it grows this on the screen is a brain organoid

it's real it was developed by some researchers at John's Hopkins University

in Baltimore in 20121 some researchers in Melbourne at the cortical lab Institute they made a miniature brain

that worked like a computer so they did something like this they made the organoid they attra attacked attached it

to some electrodes um and then and then they taught it how to play Pong the the

old school video game that's what it looked like so organoid intell

intelligence or oi uses biological materials brain cells for information

processing leveraging their inherent capabilities Beyond uh silicon-based

systems so what is on the horizon my friends are biocomputers made out of human brain

cells this is not science fiction this has already been done a few weeks ago

there was a biocomputing system made out of living human brain cells that learned

how to recognize one human voice out of

240 people's voices um using audio clips

and some other AI technology so look it's going to be a while before oi can

compete with traditional computers using AI but eventually biological computers

are going to be faster more efficient and more powerful than we have today and they will take a fraction of the amount

of energy uh in order to operate so here's your key insight biotechnology will move us past

silicon-based Computing systems and that takes us to our final set of scenarios

so what happens when we combine Ai and connectibles and

biotechnology What If instead of shrinking more transistors onto chips we

grow our computers instead we grow them rather than build them well if we're going to grow computers the organoids

are going to need to come from somewhere or from somebody this GPU from Nvidia is state-of-the-art right now for AI it

gets made in a factory I don't know who made it it doesn't really matter would

that be different though if it was a bioom computer grown from human cells

rather than manufactured in a factory What If instead of anonymous stem cells

we could order a bioom computer made from somebody a particular person's brain cells like you could choose out of

a catalog you could see their IQ you could see their academic achievements what if your

company orders a bio computer from this guy from his cells what if he's like

really really nice and he's published 200 academic papers he's a revered

mathematician he is perfect he's a

Ginger he's perfect in every possible

way but he's also a little racist what if you go on vacation do you

have to hire a computer sitter to feed and water your computer all right so we've gone through

a bunch of emerging Tech Trends biotech connectibles and AI these make up the three general purpose technologies that

are the technology super cycle I spent a lot of time today going

through basically only catastrophic scenarios because without intervention

that is what I see coming at us we've been told for decades it's not the tech

that could lead to catastrophic outcomes Tech isn't bad or good it's how the

people use the technology well what about the people building the technology

and funding the technology and their companies and the increasing control

that they exert in our everyday lives and that brings me back to these guys

the technology super cycle it's concentrating right power right now among a dangerously small group of

people who hold significant power and influence in society in government in

politics in our economies because they control our Tech resources because they've amassed great

wealth and because they control how we communicate ideas with each other some of them are famous for buying private

islands because regulations don't matter if there's no government if you're on totally private land some of them are

developing in economies are working in developed economies in places called special economic zones which are

basically regulation free little parts of cities where you can run biotech experiments you can test new Gene

therapies you can build new types of computers saving humanity is really cool

right now pretty soon the tech massias are going to try and save us from the

technology super cycle the tech Messiah each have their own unique spin on how

to save us they call it effective altruism they call it techno optimism

but from the outside it looks a heck of a lot more like free market techno

authoritarianism and I'm not okay with that we don't need someone to save us we just need to do better planning for the

future all right I told you at the beginning we're going to end on a high note we are a little bit over because of some technical challenges I know a few

of you have to leave for those of you who can stay I have specific recommendations because I do not want

you to leave here feeling fuz anymore so first government here's what

you need to do and it's not going to be popular our elected leaders need to look

forward not backwards I don't care how

old they are you need to you need to

establish a department of transition we are Gene you need to do this now that

department should stop building models what industries will the tech super cycle impact and does your company or

how is your country's GDP going to be impacted this isn't guesswork you don't need to hire some enormous Professional

Services firm you just need to get your act together and do this work the department of transition should create

kind of something like a hospice for business it's time to just acknowledge that certain businesses and jobs are

going to go away and to create a soft Landing so that doesn't your economy instead look at the fields where

a human will definitely be needed for the long term plumbers electricians dental hygienists stop insisting that

everybody go to a four-year college and get a degree and remind people that the trades are equally as valuable as and as

important um and when it's time for somebody to make the transition give them a tax deferred bank account create

a way for that family to continue to survive as they transition into the job that they're going to have next

businesses you need to do something called mapping your value Network this is something that everybody in this room

can do so a value network is a con something we teach in business school

basically it's your company and all the the partners uh and all of the different entities in your ecosystem that

co-create value with you so at its Zenith this was blackberries value Network obviously it's not totally that

this is a tiny slide but um you can see here that there were you know the telecommunications companies and the

hardware manufacturers when Blackberry innovated and advanced and created value they all created value together the

problem is and this is important for those of you at successful companies value networks are not static they

continue to evolve they're always in motion so Blackberry failed because it

aifi it completely missed the iPhone and it missed these two core areas that were

developing uh video and music they failed to see that the phone's new value proposition was not just for work

because they weren't doing this value Network mapping so a lot of companies have never done this before this is

something you can and should do because the technology supercycle will completely change what your value

network is going forward if you can do this you will effectively slow time down

and see disruption before it happens and enable you to create value going

forward that brings me to the true end and to you uh my recommendation to you

is simple I need you to fight for our future we can and should be prosperous

Brazil Germany Japan all of us all of our businesses we can be successful and

resilient the tech tech super cycle can be a net positive we can leave Humanity

in a better place we can transition into something truly amazing but we got to get to work so this is your plan first

of all download everything in this folder um this is the tech Trend report it's also all of the key slides from this

presentation okay you can take what I just did and share it share it with your co-workers you can represent it in your

companies and I actually want you to do that there's also an eight-page explainer in there on what a value

network is with explanations on how to do this on your own you can and should

do that and some of our core Frameworks as well okay two more

seconds yes almost okay um speaking of Trends final thing for the first year um

we're actually going to show you how we do our Trends uh and how we put together this report so my colleagues and I are

doing a master class every day starting today uh we we are going to take you through four modules Soup To Nuts how do

we do this work and how do you get to strategy um if you attend all four sessions there's two every day so that

we can get a maximum number of people in you will get a credential uh that that

doesn't expire and you can continue to take with you so that is it uh I need

you to join us because the future cannot wait and the tech super cycle is here remember please when you see an orange

shirt person a staff member anybody who's at South by tell them thank you I thank you thank you for being patient

and I will see you next
