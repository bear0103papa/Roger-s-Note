Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe Rogan experience. Train my day.

Peter Thiel

Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

Joe Rogan

What's up, man? Good to see you.

Peter Thiel

Glad to be on the show.

Joe Rogan

My pleasure.

Peter Thiel

Thanks for having me.

Joe Rogan

My pleasure. What's cracking? How you doing?

Peter Thiel

Doing all right.

Joe Rogan

We were just talking about how you're still trapped in LA.

Peter Thiel

I'm still trapped in LA. I know it's.

Joe Rogan

You're friends with a lot of people out here. Have you thought about Jettisong?

Peter Thiel

I talk about it all the time, and it's.

But, you know, it's always. Talk is often a substitute for action. It's always, does it lead to action or does it end up substituting for action?

Joe Rogan

That's a good point.

Peter Thiel

But I have endless conversations about leaving. I moved from San Francisco to LA back in 2018. That felt about as big a move away as possible. And I keep the extreme thing I keep saying, and I have to keep in mind talks of the substitute for action. The extreme thing I keep saying is I can't decide whether to leave the state or the country.

Joe Rogan

Oh, boy. And if you went out of the country, where would you go?

Peter Thiel

Man, it's tough to find places because there are a lot of problems in the US and most places are doing so much worse.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, it's not a good move to leave here, but this place is.

Peter Thiel

But I keep thinking I shouldn't move twice, so I should either. I can't decide whether I should move to Florida or should move to New Zealand or Costa Rica or something like that.

Joe Rogan

Yeah.

Peter Thiel

Go full John McAfee, but can't decide between those two. So I ended up stuck in California.

Joe Rogan

Well, Australia's okay, but they're even worse when it comes to rule of law and what they decide to make you do. And the way they're cracking down on people now for online speech, it's very sketchy in other countries.

Peter Thiel

But somehow the relative outperformance of the US and the absolute stagnation decline of the US, they're actually related things because the way the conversation's grooved, every time I say, tell someone I'm thinking about leaving the country, they'll do what you say, and they'll say, well, every place is worse. And then that somehow distracts us from all the problems in this country. And then we can't talk about what's gone wrong in the US because everything's so much worse.

Joe Rogan

Well, I think most people know what's gone wrong, but they don't know if they're on the side of the government that's currently in power, they don't know how to criticize it. They don't know exactly what to say, what should be done, and they're ideologically connected to this group being correct. So they try to do mental gymnastics to try to support some of the things that are going on. I think that's a part of the problem. I don't think it's necessarily that we don't know what the problems are. We know what the problems are, but we don't have clear solutions as to how to fix them, nor do we understand the real mechanisms of how they got there in the first place.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, I mean, there are a lot that are pretty obvious to articulate and they're much easier to describe than solved. Like, we have a crazy, crazy budget deficit.

And presumably you have to do one of three things.

You have to raise taxes a lot, you have to cut spending a lot, or you're just going to keep borrowing money.

Joe Rogan

Isn't there like some enormous amount of our taxes that just go to the deficit?

Peter Thiel

It's not that high, but it's gone up a lot.

Joe Rogan

What is it? What is it? I thought it was like 84% or something.

Peter Thiel

It peaked at three point. I want to say it peaked at 3.1% of GDP, which is maybe 15 20% of the budget. It peaked at 3.1% of GDP in 1991. And then it went all the way down to something like one and a half percent in the mid two thousand ten s. And now it's crept back up to. So we are at all time highs as a percentage of GDP. And the way to understand the basic math is the debt went up a crazy amount, but the interest rates went down. And from 2008 to 2021 for 13 years, we basically had zero interest rates with one brief blip under Powell, but it was basically zero rates. And then you could borrow way more money and it wouldn't show up in servicing the debt because you just paid 0% interest on the t bills.

And the thing that's very dangerous seeming to me about the current fiscal situation is the interest rates have gone back to positive like they were in the nineties and early two thousands, mid two thousands. And it's just this incredibly large debt. And so we now have a real runaway deficit problem. But people have been talking about this for 40 years and crying wool for 40 years. So it's very hard for people to take it seriously.

Joe Rogan

Most people don't even understand what it means. Like when you say there's a deficit, we owe money, okay, to who, how's that work?

Peter Thiel

It's. Well, it's, yeah, it's people who bought, who bought the bonds. And it's, you know, it's, a lot of it's to Americans. Some of them are held by the Federal Reserve. Decent amount are held by foreigners at this point, because it's, in some ways, it's the opposite of the, of the trade current account deficits. The US has been running these big current account deficits, and then the foreigners end up with way more dollars than they don't want to spend on american goods or services.

And so they have to reinvest them. In the US. Some put it into houses or stocks, but a lot of it just goes into government debt. So in some ways, it's a function of the chronic trade imbalances, chronic trade deficits.

Joe Rogan

Well, if you had supreme power, if Peter Thiel was the ruler of the world and you could fix this, what would you do?

Peter Thiel

Man, I always find, I always find that hypothetical.

It's a ridiculous hypothetical. It is ridiculous hypotheticals. You get ridiculous answers.

Joe Rogan

I want a ridiculous answer. That's what I like.

But what could be done? Like what could be done, first of all, what could be done to mitigate it and what could be done to solve it?

Peter Thiel

You know, I think my answers are probably all in the, in the very libertarian direction. So it would be sort of figure out ways to have smaller governments, figure out ways to increase the age on Social Security means test Social Security. So not everyone gets it. Just figure out ways to gradually dial back a lot of these government benefits.

And then that's, you know, that's insanely unpopular. So it's completely unrealistic on that level.

Joe Rogan

That bothers people that need Social Security.

Peter Thiel

I said means tested.

Joe Rogan

Means tested. So people who don't need it don't get it.

Peter Thiel

Right.

Joe Rogan

So Social Security, like, even if you're very wealthy, I don't even know how it works. Do you still get it?

Peter Thiel

Yeah, basically anyone who pretty much everyone gets it because it was originally rationalized as sort of a pension system, not as a welfare system. And so the fiction was you pay Social Security taxes and then you're entitled to get a pension out in the form of Social Security.

And because it was, we told this fiction that it was a form of, it was a pension system instead of an intergenerational ponzi scheme or something, something like that.

The fiction means everybody gets paid Social Security because it's a pension system. Whereas if we were more honest and said it's just a welfare system, maybe you could start dialing, you could probably rationalize in a lot of ways it's.

Joe Rogan

Not related to how much you put into it.

How does Social Security work?

Peter Thiel

I think it's partially related.

I'm not a total expert on this stuff, but I think there's some guaranteed minimum you get, and then if you put more in, you get somewhat more and then it's capped at a certain amount. And even that's why Social Security taxes are capped at something like $150,000 a year. And then this is one of the really big tax increase proposals that's out there is to uncap it, which would effectively be a 12.4% income tax hike on all your income just to Social Security. Sure. Because the argument is, the sort of progressive left Democrat argument is that it's why should you have a regressive Social Security tax? Why should you pay 12.4% or whatever the Social Security tax is? Half gets paid by you, half gets paid by your employer, but then it's capped at like 100, 4150k, some level like that. And what should be regressive, where if you make 500k or a million k a year, you pay zero tax on your marginal income and that makes no sense. If it's a welfare program, if it's a retirement savings program and your payout's capped, then you don't need to put in more than you get out of.

Joe Rogan

Well, that's logical, but there's not a lot of logic going on with the way people are talking about taxes today. Like California just jacked their taxes up to 14. What was it?

Peter Thiel

14, four, something like that. Yeah, 14. Three, I think, which is maybe more. Yeah, 49 something. Yeah.

Joe Rogan

You want more money for doing a terrible job and having more people leave for the first time ever in like the history of the state.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, but it, look, it gets away with it.

Joe Rogan

I know.

People are forced with no choice. What are you going to do?

Peter Thiel

It is there are people at the margins who leave, but the state government still collects more and more in revenues.

I don't know. You get 10% more revenues and 5% of the people leave, you still increase the amount of revenues you're getting.

It's inelastic enough that you're actually able to increase the revenues. I mean, this is sort of, the crazy thing about California is there's always sort of a right wing or libertarian critique of California that it's such a ridiculous place, it should just collapse under its own ridiculousness. And it doesn't quite happen.

The macroeconomics on it are, are pretty good. 40 million people. The GDP is around 4 trillion. It's about the same as Germany with 80 million, or Japan with 125 million. Japan has three times the population of California. Same GDP means one third the per capita GDP. So there's some level on which California as a whole is working. Even though it doesn't work from a governance point of view, it doesn't work for a lot of the people who live there. And the rough model I have for how to think of California is that it's kind of like Saudi Arabia. And you have a crazy religion, woke ism in California, wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, not that many people believe it, but it distorts everything.

And then you have oil fields in Saudi Arabia and you have the big tech companies in California, and the oil pays for everything.

And then you have a completely bloated, inefficient government sector, and you have sort of all sorts of distortions in the real estate market where people also make lots of money. And sort of the government and real estate are ways you redistribute the oil wealth or the big tech, the big tech money in California.

And it's not the way you might want to design a system from scratch, but it's, it's pretty stable. People have been saying Saudi Arabia is ridiculous. It's going to collapse any year now. They've been saying that for 40 or 50 years. But if you have a giant oil field, you can pay for a lot of ridiculousness. I think that's the way you have to think of California.

Joe Rogan

Well, the other thing is you're also.

Peter Thiel

There are things about it that are ridiculous, but there's something about it that it doesn't naturally self destruct overnight.

Joe Rogan

Well, there's a lot of kick ass people there, and there's a lot of people that are still generating enormous amounts of wealth there, and it's too difficult to just pack up and leave.

Peter Thiel

I think it's something like four of the eight or nine companies with market capitalizations over a trillion dollars are based in California.

Joe Rogan

So that's amazing.

Peter Thiel

It's Google, Apple now, Nvidia meta.

Yeah, I think Broadcom's close to that.

Joe Rogan

And there's no ideal place to live either. It's not like California sucks. So there's a place that's got it totally dialed in with also that has an enormous GDP, also has an enormous population.

There's not like one big city that's really dialed in.

Peter Thiel

Well, there are things that work. So I looked at all the zero tax states in the US.

And it's always. You don't. I think the way you ask the question gets at it, which is you don't live in a, you know, in theory, a lot of stuff happens on a state level, but you don't live in a state, you live in a city. And so if you're somewhat biased towards living in at least a moderately sized city.

Okay, I can. There are. I think there are four states where there are no cities. Alaska, Wyoming, South Dakota, New Hampshire. There's zero tax, but no cities to speak of.

And then you have Washington state with Seattle, where the weather is the worst in the country. You have Nevada with Las Vegas, which I'm not that big a fan of.

And then that leaves 30 tax states. You have Texas, which I like as a state, but I'm not that big a fan of Austin, Dallas or Houston.

It's sort of Houston.

It's just sort of an oil town, which is good if you're in that business, but otherwise not.

Dallas has sort of an inferiority complex to LA and New York.

Not the healthiest attitude. And then, I don't know, Austin's a government town and a college town and a wannabe hipster San Francisco town. So, you know, my book, sort of three strikes and you're kind of out too. And then that leaves.

That leaves Nashville, Tennessee, which was. And then, or Miami, South Florida. And those would be my two top choices.

Joe Rogan

Miami's fun, but I wouldn't want to live there. It's a fun place to visit. It's a little too crazy, a little too chaotic, a little too cocaine fueled, a little too party, party, party.

Peter Thiel

I think it's.

I think it's pretty segmented from the tourist strip, from everything else. It probably is. There probably is something a little bit paradoxical about any place that gets lots of tourists where it's in some sense, there's some things that are great about it because so many tourists go, but then in some sense, it creates a weird aesthetic because the day to day vibe is that you don't work and you're just having fun or something like that.

Joe Rogan

Right. Because so many people are going there just to do that.

Peter Thiel

And that's probably a little bit off with the South Florida thing, but I think it's.

And then I think.

I think Nashville is also sort of its own real place.

Joe Rogan

Nashville's greatest. Yeah.

Peter Thiel

So those would be my. Those are the top two.

Joe Rogan

I. I could live in Nashville no problem.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, I'm probably always. I'm always. I'm always too, you know, fifth grade onwards since, you know, 70, 77. I lived in California and so I'm just a sucker for the weather.

And I think there is no place besides coastal California. We have really good weather year round in the US. Maybe Hawaii's pretty good.

Joe Rogan

Coastal California is tough to beat and. And you're 2 hours from the mountains.

Peter Thiel

And, man, it's like, you know, it's mid August here in Austin. This is just. It's just brutal.

Joe Rogan

Is it?

Peter Thiel

I think so.

Joe Rogan

Really? That was too hot for you.

Peter Thiel

It was too hot for you.

Joe Rogan

Today's mild. Well, what is it out there, like 80?

Peter Thiel

All right.

Joe Rogan

85. 96. 96.

Peter Thiel

You're proving my point.

Joe Rogan

So much sauna that I literally don't even notice it. I'm outside for hours every day shooting arrows and I don't even notice it.

Peter Thiel

Well, that's.

I don't know if you're a representative of the average Austin.

Joe Rogan

I don't know, but I think you get accustomed to it. To me, it's so much better than too cold. Too cold. You can die, and I know you can die from the heat, but you probably won't, especially if you have water, you'll be okay. But you could die from the cold. Cold's real. So really cold places. There's five months out of the year where your life's in danger, where you could do something wrong. Like if you live in Wyoming and you break down somewhere and there's no one on the road, you could die out there. That's real. You could die from exposure.

Peter Thiel

Sure. There's probably some very deep reason. There's been a net migration of people to the west and the south and the US over California.

Joe Rogan

You can do no wrong. As long as the earth doesn't move, you're good. As long as there's no tsunamis, you're good. It is a perfect environment, virtually year round. It gets a little hot in the summer, but again, coastal, not at all. If you get an 80 degree day in Malibu, it's unusual, you know, it's wonderful. You got a beautiful breeze coming off the ocean. Sun's out, everybody's pretty.

Peter Thiel

And then. And then it's. Yeah, it's. It's correlated with confiscatory taxation. They all sort of a package deal.

Joe Rogan

Well, it's a scam, you know. They know you don't want to leave. I didn't want to leave California. It's fucking great.

Peter Thiel

I appreciate you left. I always have the fantasy that if enough people like you leave, it'll put pressure on them, but it's never quite.

Joe Rogan

Enough, never quite enough. And it's not going to be. It's too difficult for most people. It was very difficult for me, and I had a bunch of people working for me that were willing to pack up and leave, like young Jamie over there. But we. You know, it was tricky.

You're taking your whole business, and my business is talking to people. That's part of my business. My other business is stand up comedy.

Peter Thiel

So you left during COVID or.

Joe Rogan

I left at the very beginning. As soon as they started locking things down, I'm like, oh, these motherfuckers are never living.

Peter Thiel

March, April, May, 2020.

Joe Rogan

May. I started looking at houses.

Peter Thiel

Cool.

Joe Rogan

That's when I came to Austin first.

Peter Thiel

I got a place in Miami in September 2020 and spent the last. You know, I've spent the last four winters there. So I'm sort of always on the cusp of moving to Florida. Hard to get out of California.

But the thing that's gotten a lot harder about moving relative to four years ago, and I'd say, I think my real estate purchases have generally not been. Not been great over the years. They've done okay, but certainly not the way I've been able to make money at all. But with the one exception was Miami bought it in September 2020, and probably fast forward four years, it's up, like 100% or something like that.

But then, paradoxically, this also means it's gotten much harder to move there or Austin or any of these places.

If I relocated my office in LA, the people who own houses, you have to buy a place in Florida. It costs twice as much as it did four years ago. And then the interest rates have also doubled. And so you get a 30 year mortgage. You could have locked that in for 3% in 2020.

Now it's, you know, maybe six and a half, 7%. So the prices have doubled, the mortgages have doubled. So it costs you four times as much to buy a house. And so, yeah, so there was a moment where people could move during COVID and it's gotten dramatically harder relative to what it was four years ago.

Joe Rogan

Well, the Austin real estate market went crazy, and then it came back down a little bit. It's in that down a little bit spot right now where there's a lot of, like, high end properties that are still for sale. They can't move. It's different. You know, there's not a lot of people moving here now like there was in the boom, because everything's open everywhere.

Peter Thiel

Well, I somehow think Austin was linked to California, and Miami was linked a little bit more to New York, and it was a little bit, you know, all these differences. But I. Austin was kind of, you know, a big part of the move were people from tech, from California that moved to Austin. You know, there's a part of the Miami South Florida thing, which was people from finance in New York, New York City that moved to Florida. And the finance industry is less networked on New York City. So I think it is possible for people, if you run a private equity fund or if you work at a bank, it's possible for some of those functions to easily be moved to a different state.

The tech industry is crazily networked on California. Like, there's probably some way to do it.

It's not that easy.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, it makes sense.

It makes sense, too. It's just the sheer numbers. I mean, when you're talking about all those corporations that are established and based in California, there's so many. They're so big. Just the sheer numbers of human beings that live there and work there that are involved in tech.

Peter Thiel

Sure, if it wasn't as networked, you could probably just move.

And maybe these things are networked till they're not. Detroit was very networked. The car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades and decades, and Michigan got more and more mismanaged, and people thought the network sort of protected them because the big three car companies were in Detroit. But then you had all the supply chains were also in Detroit. And then eventually, it was just so ridiculous. People moved, started moving the factories outside of that area, and it sort of unraveled. So that's, you know, it can also happen with California. It'll just take a lot.

Joe Rogan

That would be insane if they just abandoned all the tech companies in California. I mean, just look at what happened at Flint, Michigan, when all the auto factories pulled out.

Peter Thiel

Well, it's.

Look, I think you can. It's always. There are all these paradoxical histories. The Internet. The point of the Internet, in some sense, was to eliminate the tyranny of place.

And that was sort of the idea. And then one of the paradoxes about the history of the Internet was that the Internet companies were all, you know, we're all centered in California.

There have been different waves of how networked, how non networked they were.

I think probably 2021, sort of the COVID moving away from California. The big thing in tech was crypto, and crypto had this conceit of alternate currency decentralized away from the central banks. But also the crypto companies, the crypto protocols, you could do those from anywhere. You could do them outside the US, you could do them from Miami. And so crypto was something where the tech could naturally move out of California.

And today probably the.

I don't know, the core tech narrative is completely flipped to AI.

And then there's something about AI that's very centralized.

I had this one liner years ago where if we say that crypto is libertarian, can we also say that AI is communist or something like this, where the natural structure for an AI company looks like it's a big company, and then somehow the AI stuff feels like it's going to be dominated by the big tech companies in the San Francisco Bay Area.

And so that's the future for tech. That's the future of tech.

The scale, the natural scale of the industry tells you that it's going to be extremely hard to get out of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Joe Rogan

When you look to the future and you try to just make just a guess as to how all this is going to turn out with AI, what do you think we're looking at over the next five years?

Peter Thiel

Man? I think I should start by being modest in answering that question, saying that nobody has a clue, right?

Joe Rogan

Which is true, which pretty much all the experts say.

Peter Thiel

You know, I would say, let me do sort of a history.

The riff I always had on this was that I can't stand any of the buzzwords. And I felt AI, there's all this big data, cloud computing. There were all these crazy buzz words people had, and they always were ways to sort of abstract things and get away from reality somehow and were not good ways of talking about things. And I thought AI was this incredible abstraction because it can mean I the next generation of computers, it can mean the last generation of computers. It can mean anything in between.

And if you think about the AI discussion in the 2010s, pre OpenAI chat, GPT, and the revolution of the last two years. But the discussion maybe it was. So I'll start with the history before I get to the future. But the history of it was, it was maybe anchored on two visions of what AI meant. And one was Nick Bostrom, Oxford professor, who wrote this book, Super Intelligence 2014. And it was basically AI was going to be this super duper intelligent thing, way godlike intelligence, way smarter than any human being. And then there was sort of the. The. I don't know, the CCP, chinese communist rebuttal, the Kai Fu Li book from 2018, AI superpowers. I think the subtitle was something like the race for AI between Silicon Valley and China or something like this.

And it was sort of. It defined AI as it was fairly low tech. It was just surveillance, you know, facial recognition technology.

We would just have this sort of totalitarian stalinist monitoring. It didn't require very much innovation. It just required that you apply things. And basically the subtext was China is going to win because we have no ethical qualms in China about applying this sort of basic machine learning to sort of measuring or controlling the population.

And those were sort of like, say, two extreme competing visions of what AI would mean in the. That sort of maybe were sort of the anchors of the AI debate.

And then what happened in some sense, with chat GPT in late 22, early 23, was that the achievement you got, you did not get superintelligence. It was not just surveillance tech, but you actually got to the holy grail of what people would have defined AI as from 1950 to 2010. For the previous 60 years before the 2010s, people have always said AI, the definition of AI is passing the Turing test and the Turing test.

It basically means that the computer can fool you into thinking that it's a human being.

And it's a somewhat fuzzy test because obviously you have an expert on the computer, a non expert.

Does it fool you all the time or some of the time? How good is it? But to first approximation the Turing test, we weren't even close to passing it in 2021. And then chat GPT basically passes the Turing test, at least for, like, let's say, an IQ 100 average person.

It's passed the Turing test. And that was the Holy Grail.

That was the holy grail of AI research for the previous 60 years. And so I know there's probably some psychological or sociological history where you can say that this weird debate between Bostrom about superintelligence and Kai fu li about surveillance tech was like this, almost like psychological suppression people had where they were not thinking. They lost track of the Turing test, of the Holy Grail, because it was about to happen. And it was such a significant, such an important thing that you didn't even want to think about. So I'm tempted to give almost a psychological repression theory of the 2010 debates. But be that as it may, the Turing test gets passed, and that's an extraordinary achievement. And then maybe.

And then where does it go from here?

There probably are ways you can refine these. It's still going to be a long time to apply it. There is a question.

There's this AGI discussion.

Will we get artificial general intelligence, which is a hopelessly vague concept, which general intelligence could be just a generally smart human being. So is that just a person with an iq of 130 or is it super intelligence? Is it godlike intelligence?

So it's sort of an ambiguous thing.

But I keep thinking that maybe the AGI question is less important than passing the Turing test.

If we got AGI, if we got, let's say, super intelligence. If we got. That would be interesting to mister God because you'd have competition for being God.

But surely the Turing test is more important for us humans because it's either a complement or a substitute to humans. And so it's going to rearrange the economic, cultural, political structure of our society in extremely dramatic ways. And I think maybe what's already happened is much more important than anything else that's going to be done, and then it's just going to be a long ways in applying it.

One last thought.

The analogy I'm always tempted to go to, and these things are never historical, analogies are never perfect, but it's. It's that maybe AI in 20, 23, 24 is like.

It's like the Internet in 1999, where on one level it's clear the Internet's going to be big and get a lot bigger and it's going to dominate the economy, it's going to rearrange the society in the 21st century.

And then at the same time, it was a complete bubble and people had no idea how the business models worked.

Almost everything blew up.

It didn't take that long in the scheme of things. It took 1520 years for it to become super dominant, but it didn't happen in 18 months as people fantasized in 1999.

And maybe what we have in AI is something like this.

Figuring out how to actually apply it in sort of all these different ways is going to take something like two decades, but that doesn't distract from it being a really big deal.

Joe Rogan

It is a really big deal, and I think you're right about the Turing test. Do you think that the lack of acknowledgement or the public celebration, or at least this mainstream discussion, which I think should be everywhere, that we've passed the Turing test? Do you think it's connected to the fact that this stuff accelerates so rapidly that even though we've essentially breached this new territory, we still know that GPT five is going to be better, GPT six is going to be insane, and then they're working on these right now, and the change is happening so quickly, we're almost a little reluctant to acknowledge where we're at to.

Peter Thiel

You know, I've often. I've probably for 15 years or so, often been on the side that there isn't that much progress in science or tech or not as much as Silicon Valley likes to claim.

And even on the AI level, I think it's a massive technical achievement. It's still an open question, you know, is it actually going to lead to much higher living standards for everybody? You know, the Internet was a massive achievement. How much it raised people's living standards?

Much, much trickier question, so.

But in this world, where not much has happened, one of the paradoxes of an era of relative tech stagnation is that when something does happen, we don't even know how to process it. So I think bitcoin was a.

It was a big invention, whether it was good or bad, but it was a pretty big deal. And it was systematically underestimated for at least the first 1011 years.

You could trade it. It went up smoothly for 1011 years. It didn't get repriced all at once because we're in a world where nothing big ever happens, and so we. We have no way of processing it when something pretty big happens. The Internet was pretty big in 99. Bitcoin was moderately big. The Internet was really big. Bitcoin was moderately big. And I'd say passing the Turing test is really big. It's on the same scale as the Internet.

Because our lived experiences that so little has felt like it's been changing for the last few decades, we're probably underestimating it.

Joe Rogan

It's interesting that you say that so little. We feel like so little has changed, because if you're a person, how old are you?

Peter Thiel

Same age as you were born in 1967.

Joe Rogan

So in our age, we've seen all the change, right? We saw the end of the cold war, we saw answering machines, we saw vhs tapes, then we saw the Internet. And then where we're at right now, which is like this bizarre moment in time where people carry the Internet around with them in their pocket every day. And these super sophisticated computers that are ubiquitous, everybody has one. There's incredible technology that's being ramped up every year. They're getting better all the time. And now there's AI. There's AI on your phone. You could access chat, GPT, and a bunch of different programs on your phone. And I think that's an insane change. I think that's one of the most, especially with the use of social media. It's one of the most bizarre changes. I think our culture is ever the most bizarre.

Peter Thiel

It can be a big change culturally or politically.

But, yeah, the kinds of questions I'd ask is, how do you measure it economically?

How much does it change GDP? How much does it change productivity?

And certainly the story I would generally tell for the last 50 years, since the 1970s, early seventies, is that we've been not absolute stagnation. We've been in an era of relative stagnation where there has been very limited progress in the world of atoms, the world of physical things, and there has been a lot of progress in the world of bits, information, computers, Internet, mobile, Internet, you know, now AI.

Joe Rogan

What are you referring to when you say in the world of physical things?

Peter Thiel

You know, it's any.

It's. Well, if we had to find technology, if we were sitting here in 1967, the year we were born, and we had a discussion about technology, what technology would have meant? Would it would have meant computers, it would have also meant rockets, it would have meant supersonic airplanes, it would have meant new medicines, it would have meant the green revolution in agriculture, maybe underwater cities.

You know, it sort of had.

Because technology simply gets defined as that which is changing, that which is progressing. And so there's progress on all these fronts today. Last 20 years, when you talk about technology, you're normally just talking about information. Technology has been reduced to meaning computers. And that tells you that the structure of progress has been weird. There's been this narrow cone of very intense progress around the world of bits, around the world of computers, and then all the other areas have been relatively stagnant. We're not moving any faster. You know, the Concorde got decommissioned in 2003 or whenever.

And then with all the low tech airport security measures, it takes even longer to fly to get through all of them, from one city to the next. The highways have gone backwards because there are more traffic jams. We haven't figured out ways around those. So we're literally moving slower than we were 40 or 50 years ago.

And then. Yeah, and that's sort of the.

And then, of course, there's also a sense in which the screens and the devices have this effect, distracting us from this. So when you're riding a hundred year old subway in New York City and you're looking at your iPhone, you can look at, wow, this is this cool new gadget. But you're also being distracted from the fact that your lived environment hasn't changed in 100 years.

And so there's a question. How important is this world of bits versus the world of atoms? I would say, as human beings, we're physically embodied in a material world. And so I would always say this world of atoms is pretty important.

And when that's pretty stagnant, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. I was an undergraduate at Stanford, late eighties.

And at the time, in retrospect, every engineering area would have been a bad thing to go into. You know, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, all these engineering fields where you're tinkering and trying to do new things. Because these things turned out to be stuck. They were regulated, couldn't come up with new things to do. Nuclear engineering, aero, astro engineering, people already knew those were really bad ones to go into. They were outlawed. You weren't going to make any progress in new nuclear reactor designs or stuff like that.

Electrical engineering, which was the one that's sort of adjacent to making semiconductors, that one was still okay. And then the only field that was actually going to progress a lot was computer science. And again, it's been very powerful. But that was not the felt sense in the 1980s. In the 1980s, computer science was this ridiculous, inferior subject.

The linguistic cut is always when people use the word science favor of science. I'm not in favor of science in quotes. And it's always a tell that it's not real science. And so when we call it climate science or political science or social science, you know, you're just sort of making it up and you have an inferiority complex to real science or something like physics or chemistry. And computer science was in the same category as social science or political science. It was a fake field for people who found electrical engineering or math way too hard and sort of dropped out of the real science and real engineering fields.

Joe Rogan

You don't feel that climate science is a real science?

Peter Thiel

It is.

Well, there's several different things. One could say it's possible climate change is happening. It's possible we don't have great accounts of why that's going on. So I'm not questioning any of those things, but how scientific it is.

I don't think it's a place where we have really vigorous debates. Maybe the climate is increasing because of carbon dioxide emissions, temperatures are going up, maybe it's methane, maybe it's people who are eating too much steak. It's the cows flatulating. And you have to measure how much is methane a greenhouse gas, versus carbon dioxide.

I don't think they're rigorously doing that stuff scientifically. I think the fact that it's called climate science tells you that it's more dogmatic than anything that's truly science should be. Why dogma doesn't mean it's wrong.

Joe Rogan

But why does the fact that it's called climate science mean that it's more dogmatic? Because if you said nuclear science, you wouldn't question it, right? It's.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, but no one calls it nuclear science. They call it nuclear engineering. Interesting. I'm just. The only thing is, I'm just making a narrow linguistic point.

Joe Rogan

I think it's science that is legitimately science.

Peter Thiel

Well, at this point people say computer science has worked. But in the 1980s, all I'm saying is it was in the same category as, let's say, social science, political science.

It was a tell that the people doing it kind of deep down knew they weren't doing real science.

Joe Rogan

Well, there's certainly ideology that's connected to climate science, and then there's certainly corporations that are invested in this prospect of green energy and the concept of green energy, and they're profiting off of it and pushing these different things, whether it be electric car mandates or whatever. It is like California, I think it's 2035. They have a mandate that all new vehicles have to be electric, which is hilarious when you're connected to a grid that can't support the electric cars it currently has.

After they said that within a month or two, Gavin Newsom asked people to not charge their Teslas because it was summer and the grid was fucked.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, look, it was all linked into all these ideological projects in all these ways.

There's, you know, there's. There's an environmental project which is, you know, and maybe. Maybe it shouldn't be scientific. You know, there's, you know, the hardcore environmentalist argument is we only have one planet and we don't have time to do science. If we. If we have to do rigorous science and you can prove that we're overheating, it'll be too late.

And so if you're a hardcore environmentalist, you know, you don't want to have as high a standard of science.

Yeah, my intuition is certainly when you go away from that, you end up with things that are too dogmatic, too ideological. Maybe it doesn't even work, even if the planet's getting warmer.

Maybe climate science is not.

My question is maybe methane is a worse.

Is it more dangerous greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide?

We're not even capable of measuring that.

Joe Rogan

Well, we're also ignoring certain things like regenerative farms that sequester carbonous. And then you have people like Bill Gates saying that planting trees to deal with carbon is ridiculous. That's a ridiculous way to do it.

How is that ridiculous? They literally turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. It is their food. That's what the food of plants is. That's what powers the whole plant life and the way we have the symbiotic relationship with them. And the more carbon dioxide is, the greener it is, which is why it's greener today on earth than it has been in 100 years.

Peter Thiel

Sure.

Joe Rogan

These are all facts that are inconvenient to people that have a very specific, narrow window of how to approach this.

Peter Thiel

Sure. Although there probably are ways to steal man. The other side, too, where maybe the original 1970s, I think the manifesto that's always very interesting from the other side was this book by the Club of Rome, 1972, the limits of growth. And it's. You can't have.

We need to head towards a society in which there's 0%, there's very limited growth, because if you have unlimited growth, you're going to run out of resources. If you don't run out of resources, you'll hit a pollution constraint. But in the 1970s, it was, you're going to have overpopulation, you're going to run out of oil. We had the oil shocks, and then by the nineties, it sort of morphed into more of the pollution problem with carbon dioxide, climate change, other environmental things.

But there is sort of.

There's been some improvement in oil, carbon fuels, with fracking, things like this in Texas, it's not at the scale that's been enough to give an american standard of living to the whole planet. We consume 100 million barrels of oil a day globally.

Maybe fracking can add 10%, 10 million to that. If everybody on this planet has an american standard of living, it's something like 300, 400 million barrels of oil, and I don't think that's there. So that's kind of.

I always wonder whether that was. The real environmental argument is we can't have an american standard of living for the whole planet. We somehow can't justify this degree of inequality, and therefore we have to figure out ways to dial back and tax the carbon, restrict it.

And maybe that's.

There's some sort of a malthusian calculus that's more about resources than about pollution.

Joe Rogan

How much of that, the demand for oil could be mitigated by nuclear?

Peter Thiel

You probably could mitigate it a lot.

There's a question why the nuclear thing has gone so wrong, especially if you have electric vehicles. Right?

Combustion engine is probably hard to get nuclear to work, but if you shift to electric vehicles, you can charge them, your Tesla cars, at night.

And that would seemingly work.

And there's definitely a history of energy where it was always in the direction of more intense use. It went from wooden to coal to oil, which is a more compact form of energy. And in a way takes up less of the environment. And then if we move from oil to uranium, that's even.

It's even smaller. And so in a sense, the smaller, the more dense the energy is, the less of the environment it takes up. And when we go back, when we go from oil to natural gas, which takes up more space, and from natural gas to solar or wind, you have to pollute the whole environment by putting up windmills everywhere, or you have to cover the whole desert with solar panels.

Joe Rogan

That is a good way to look at it because it is a form of pollution.

Peter Thiel

There was a way that nuclear was supposed to be the energy mode of the 21st century.

Then. Yeah, there are these historical questions. Why did it get stopped? Why did we not.

Why did we not go down that route?

The standard explanation of why it stopped was that there were all these dangers. We had three mile on 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and then the Fukushima one in Japan, I think 2011.

And you had these sort of. You had these various accidents.

My alternate theory on why nuclear energy really stopped is that it was sort of dystopian or even apocalyptic, because it turned out that it was all. It turned out to be very dual use. If you build nuclear power plants, it's only sort of one step away from building nuclear weapons.

And it turned out to be a lot trickier to separate those two things out than it looked. And I think the signature moment was 1974 or 75, when India gets the nuclear bomb. And the US, I believe, had transferred the nuclear reactor technology to India. We thought they couldn't weaponize it. And then it turned out it was pretty easy to weaponize.

And then sort of the geopolitical problem with nuclear power was you either you need a double standard where we have nuclear power in the US, but we don't allow other countries to have nuclear power because the US gets to keep its nuclear weapons. We don't let 100 other countries have nuclear weapons.

That's an extreme double standard, probably a little bit hard to justify.

Or you need some kind of really effective global governance where you have a one world government that regulates all this stuff, which doesn't sound that good either.

And then sort of the compromise was just to regulate it so much that maybe the nuclear plants got grandfathered in, but it became too expensive to build new ones.

Joe Rogan

Jesus.

Peter Thiel

Like even China, which is the country where they're building the most nuclear power plants. They built way less than people expected a decade ago because they don't trust their own designs. And so they have to copy the over safety, over protected designs from the west and the nuclear plants. Nuclear power costs too much money. It's cheaper to do coal.

Joe Rogan

Wow.

Peter Thiel

I don't get the numbers exactly right, but if you look at what percent of chinese electricity was nuclear, it wasn't that high. It was like maybe four or 5% in 2013, 2014. And the percent hasn't gone up in ten years because they've maybe doubled the amount of electricity they use and maybe they doubled the nuclear. The relative percentage is still a pretty small part of the mix because it's just more expensive. When you have these oversafe designed reactors, there are probably ways to build small reactors that are way cheaper. But then you still have this dual use thing. Do you create plutonium?

Are there ways you can create a pathway to building more nuclear weapons?

Joe Rogan

And if there was innovation, if nuclear engineering had gotten to a point where, let's say there wasn't three Mile island or Chernobyl didn't happen, do you think that it would have gotten to a much more efficient and much more effective version by now?

Peter Thiel

Well, my understanding is we have way more efficient designs.

You can do small reactor designs, which are. You don't need this giant containment structure, so it costs much less per kilowatt hour of electricity you produce. So I think we have those designs. They're just not allowed.

But then I think the problem is that if you were able to build them in all these countries all over the world, you still have this dual use problem.

And again, my alternate history of what really went wrong with nuclear power, it wasn't three mile, it wasn't Chernobyl. That's the official story. The real story was India getting the bomb.

Joe Rogan

Wow. That makes sense. It completely makes sense. Geez Louise.

Peter Thiel

And then this is always the question about.

There's always a big picture question. People ask me if I'm right about this picture of the slowdown in tech, the stagnation in many, many dimensions. And then there's always a question, why did this happen?

And my cop out answer is always, why? Questions are overdetermined because there are multiple reasons. So it could be why. It could be we became a more feminized, risk averse society. It could be that the education system worked less well. It could be that we were just out of ideas. The easy ideas have been found. The hard ideas, the cupboard, nature's cupboard. Was bare. The low hanging fruit had been picked, so it can be over determined. But I think one dimension that's not to be underrated for the science and tech stagnation was that an awful lot of science and technology had this dystopian or apocalyptic dimension. And probably what happened at Los Alamos in 1945. And then with the thermonuclear weapons in the early fifties, it took a while for it to really seep in, but it had this sort of delayed effect where maybe a stagnant world in which the physicists don't get to do anything and they have to putter around with Dei, and you're not, you know, but you don't build weapons that blow up the world anymore.

Is that a feature or a bug? And so the stagnation was sort of like this response. And so it sucks that we've lived in this world for 50 years where a lot of stuff has been inert, but if we had a world that was still accelerating on all these dimensions with supersonics and hypersonic planes and hypersonic weapons and, you know, modular nuclear reactors, maybe we wouldn't be sitting here and the whole world would have already blown up. And so we're in that. We're in the stagnant path of the multiverse because it had this partially protective thing, even though in all these other ways, I feel it's deeply deranged our society.

Joe Rogan

That's a very interesting perspective, and it makes a lot of sense. It really does. And particularly the dual use thing with nuclear power and especially distributing that to other countries.

When you talk about the stagnation in this country, I don't know how much you follow this whole UAP nonsense. I know we met. What was that guy's name at your place?

The guy who did chariots of the gods?

Peter Thiel

Oh, Fondant.

Joe Rogan

Yes.

Peter Thiel

Yeah. You didn't. You thought he was too crazy. You like Hancock, but you don't like Fondanikin.

Joe Rogan

I didn't think he's too crazy. He just willfully, in my opinion, ignores evidence that would show that some of the things that he's saying have already been solved.

And I think his hypothesis is all related to this concept that we have been visited and that that's how all these things were built and that this technology was brought here from another world. And I think he's very ideologically locked into these ideas. And I think a much more compelling idea is that there were very advanced cultures. For some reason, 10,000 years ago, whatever it was, whatever the year was, where they built some of the insane structures, it's 4500 years ago. They roughly think the pyramids were built like whatever the fuck was going on there.

I think those were human beings. I think those were human beings in that place, in that time. And I think they had some sort of very sophisticated technology that was lost. And things can get lost. Things can get lost in cataclysms, things can get lost in.

They can get lost in disease and famine and there's all sorts of war, all sorts of reasons. The burning of the library of Alexandria. There's all sorts of ways that technology gets lost forever. And you can have today someone living in Los Angeles in the most sophisticated high tech society the world has ever known, while you still have people that live in the Amazon that live in the same way that they have lived for thousands of years. So those things can happen in the same planet at the same time. And I think while the rest of the world was essentially operating at a much lower vibration, there were people in Egypt that were doing some extraordinary things.

I don't know how they got the information. Maybe they did get it from visitors. Maybe they did. No real compelling evidence that they did. I think there's much more compelling evidence that a cataclysm happened. When you look at the younger Dryas impact theory, it's all entirely based on science. It's entirely based on core samples and iridium content and also massive changes in the environment over a very short period of time, particularly the melting of the ice caps in North America and just impact craters all around the world that we know something happened roughly 11,000 years ago and probably again 10,000 years ago. I think it's a regular occurrence on this planet that things go sideways and there's massive natural disasters. And I think that it's very likely.

Peter Thiel

That there's the bronze age civilization collapse somewhere in the mid 12th century BC.

And probably in some ways, the one in which we have the best history is the fall of the Roman Empire, which was obviously the culmination of the classical world. And it's somehow. It's somehow extremely unravel. So my. Yeah, I think. I think my, my view on it is probably somewhere between yours and the von Daniken. No, not von Daniken. I'm more on the. More on the. More on the prob.

The other side. But let me, let me. Let me try to define why this may agree on why this is so important today. This is not just of antiquarian interest. The reason it matters today is because the alternative, if you say civilization has seen great rises and falls. It's gone through these great cycles.

Maybe the Bronze Age civilizations were very advanced, but someone came up with iron weapons, so there was just one dimension where they progressed, but then everything else they could destroy.

Or the fall of the Roman Empire was again this pretty cataclysmic thing where there were diseases and then there were political things that unraveled. But somehow it was a massive regression for 405, 600 years into the dark ages.

The sort of naive, the progressive views, things always just got monotonically better. And there's sort of this revisionist, purely progressive history where even the roman empire didn't decline. And even, you know, this one sort of stupid way to quantify this stuff is with pure demographics. And so it's the question how many people lived in the past? And I. And the rises and falls of civilization story is there were more people who lived in the roman empire because it was more advanced. It could support a larger population, and then the population declined. The city of Rome maybe had a million people at its peak. And then by, I don't know, 650 ad, it's maybe it's down to 10,000 people or less. You have this complete collapse in population.

And then the sort of alternate, purely progressive view is the population has always just been monotonically increasing because it's a measure of how, in some sense, things in aggregate have always been getting better. So I am definitely on your side. That population had great rises and falls. Civilizations had great rises and falls.

And so that part of it, I agree with you, or even, you know, some variant of what Hancock or Pandan can say.

The place where I would say I think things are different is I don't think. I don't think.

And therefore, it seems possible something could happen to our civilization. That's always the upshot of it. If it had been monotonically, always progressing, then there's nothing we should worry about. Nothing can possibly go wrong. And then certainly the thing, the sort of alternate Hancock von Daniken, Joe Rogan history of the world tells us is that we shouldn't take our civilization for granted. There are things that can go really haywire. I agree with that. The one place where I differ is I do think our civilization today is on some dimensions way more advanced than any of these past civilizations were. I don't think any of them had nuclear weapons. I don't think any of them had spaceships or anything like that.

And so the failure mode is likely to be somewhat different from these past ones.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, that makes sense.

I think technology progressed in a different direction. That's what I think. I think structural technology, building technology, had somehow or another achieved levels of competence that's not available today.

When you look at the construction of the great pyramid of Giza, there's 2,300,000 stones in it.

The whole thing points to due north, south, east and west. It's an incredible achievement. The stones, some of them were moved from a quarry that was 500 miles away through the mountains. They have no idea how they did it. Massive stones, the ones inside the king's chamber, where they're like, the biggest ones are like 80 tons. It's crazy. The whole thing's crazy. Like, how did they do that? Like, whatever they did, they did without machines, supposedly. They did without the use of the combustion engine. They didn't have electricity. And yet they were able to do something that stands the test of time. Time, not just so you could look at it, you know, like, you can go to the Acropolis and see the Parthenon. It's gorgeous. It's amazing. It's incredible. But I can understand how people could have built it. The pyramids is one of those things you just look at. You go, what the fuck was going on here? What was going on here? And none of these people are still around. You have this strange culture now that's entirely based around. You know, you have Cairo and an enormous population of visitors, right? Which is a lot of it. People just going to stare at these ancient relics.

What was going on that those people were so much more advanced than anyone, anywhere else in the world?

Peter Thiel

Yeah.

I'm not sure I would anchor on the technological part, but I think the piece that is very hard for us to comprehend is what motivated them culturally.

Joe Rogan

Well, how did they do it physically?

Peter Thiel

Why did they do it? Why were you motivated?

Joe Rogan

Why? But also, how. How is a big one? Because it's really difficult to solve. There's no traditional, conventional explanations for the construction, the movement of the stones, the amount of time that it would take. If you move ten stones a day, I believe it takes 664 years to make one of those pyramids. So how many people were involved? How long did it take? How'd they get them there? How'd they figure out how to do it? How come the shittier pyramids seemed to be dated later?

What was going on in that particular period of time where they figured out how to do something so extraordinary that even today, 4500 years later, we stare at it and we go, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck they did.

Peter Thiel

I haven't studied it carefully enough.

I'll trust you, that it's very hard.

I think the. I would say the real mystery is why were they motivated? And it's because you can't live in a pyramid. It's just. It was just the afterlife of the pharaoh.

Joe Rogan

There's some debate about that. Christopher Dunn, as an engineer, who believes that it was some sort of a power plant, he's got this very bizarre theory that there was a chamber that exists.

You see the structure of the pyramid, the inside of it, there's a chamber that's subterranean. And he believes the subterranean chamber was pounding on the surface of the earth and of the walls of the thing, creating this very specific vibration. They had shafts that came down into the queen's chamber. These shafts. They would pour chemicals into these shafts. And then there was limestone at the end of it. This is all his theory, not mine.

The end of it, there was this limestone, which is permeable, right? So the limestone, which is porous, these gases come through and creates this hydrogen that's inside of this chamber. Then there are these shafts inside the king's chamber that are getting energy from space, gamma rays and all the shit from space. And it's going through these chambers, which are very specifically designed to target these gases and put them into this chamber where they would interact with this energy. And he believes it's enough to create electricity.

Peter Thiel

Man, my.

Joe Rogan

It's a crazy theory.

Peter Thiel

Look, I'm always too fast to debunk all these things, but, like, my just coming back to our earlier conversation, it must have been a crazy power plant to have a containment structure much bigger than a nuclear reactor.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, well, it's ridiculous, but it's also a different kind of technology, right? If nuclear technology was completely not on the table, they didn't understand atoms at all, but they did understand that there's rays that come from space and that you could somehow harness the energy of these things with specific gases and through some method, convert that into some form of electricity.

Peter Thiel

But if it takes so much power to put all these rocks on the pyramid, you have to always look at how efficient the power plant is.

So it can't just be some. It has to be, like, the craziest reaction ever to justify such a big containment structure. Because even nuclear power plants don't work economically. Barely work.

Joe Rogan

Well, they didn't do a lot of them. They only did this one in Giza. And then there was other pyramids that he thinks had different functions that were smaller. But the whole purpose of it is. Or the whole point of it is we don't know what the fuck it is. We don't know why they did it. We have a group of new archaeologists that are looking at it from a completely different theory. They're not looking at it like it's a tomb. The established archaeologists have insisted that this is a tomb for the pharaoh. The newer archaeologists, established archaeologists, are looking at it and considering whether or not there were some other uses for this thing. And one of them is the concept of the pharaoh product.

Peter Thiel

I'm always, I don't know if this is an alternate history theory, but I'm always into the James Fraser Golden Bough, Rene Girard violence, sacred history, where you have always this question about the origins of monarchy and kingship and the sort of Gerard Fraziere intuition is that it's something like.

It is something like if every king is a kind of living God, then we have to also believe the opposite, that maybe every God is a dead or murdered king, and that somehow societies were organized around scapegoats. The scapegoats were, you know, there was sort of a crisis in the archaic community. It got blamed on a scapegoat. The scapegoat was attributed all these powers. And then at some point, the scapegoat, before he gets executed, figures out a way to postpone his execution and turn the power into something real. And so there's sort of this very weird adjacency between the monarch and the scapegoat. And then, you know, I don't know, the sort of riff on the would be that the first pyramid did not need to be invented. It was just the stones that were thrown on a victim, and then it somehow.

And that's the original.

Joe Rogan

The stones that were thrown on a.

Peter Thiel

Victim, a community stones, a victim to death.

Tribe runs after a victim, you stone him to death, you throw stones on the victim. That's how you create the first tomb.

Joe Rogan

Hmm. And then as it gets more complicated, you create a tomb that's 2 million.

Peter Thiel

Stones, and you get a pharaoh who figures out a way to postpone his own execution or something like this. I think there's.

I'm going to blank on the name of this ritual, but I believe in the old egyptian kingdoms, which were sort of around the time of the great pyramids or even before.

It was something like in the 30th year of the reign of the pharaoh, the pharaoh gets transformed into a living God.

And then this perhaps dates to a time where in the 30th year of the pharaoh's reign, the pharaoh would get ritually sacrificed or killed. And you have all these societies where the kings lived were allowed to rule for an allotted time, where you become king and you draw the number of pebbles out of a base. And that corresponds to. How many years was this, Jamie? The Sed festival.

Joe Rogan

Heb Sed festival of tales, an ancient egyptian ceremony that celebrated the continued rule of pharaoh. The name was taken from the name of the egyptian wolf God, one of whom's name was whipwed.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, whipwed. This is what I'm talking about.

Joe Rogan

Or sedan, the less formal feast. Name. The feast of the tale is derived.
