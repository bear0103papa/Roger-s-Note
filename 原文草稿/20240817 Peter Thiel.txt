Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan

podcast by night all day what's up man good to see you glad to be on the show my my pleasure thanks

for having me my pleasure what's Kraken how you doing doing all right we were just talking about how you're still trapped in La I'm still trapped in La I

know it's you're friends with a lot of people out here have you thought about uh jettison I uh I talk about it all the

time and uh it's but you know it's always talk is often a substitute for action it's always does it does it lead to

action or does it does it end up substituting for action and uh that's a good point but I have endless conversations about leaving I moved from

San Francisco to LA back in 2018 that felt uh felt about as big a move away as

possible and uh I keep I keep the the extreme thing I keep saying and again I have to keep in mind talks as a

substitute for Action the extreme thing I keep saying is I can't decide whether to leave the state or the country oh boy and uh

if you went out of the country where would you go man I've uh it's it's it's tough to find places because uh you know

there are a lot of problems in the US and most places are doing so much worse yeah so it's not a good move to leave

here [ __ ] up as this place is but but I keep uh I keep I keep thinking I I shouldn't move twice so I should either

I can't decide whether I should move to Florida or should move to you know New

Zealand or Costa Rica or something like that yeah yeah go full John McAfee and

so I but can't decide between those two so end up stuck in California well

Australia is okay but they're even worse when it comes to rule of law and what they decide to make you do and the way

they're cracking down on people now for online speech and it's it's very sketchy in other

countries it's uh but somehow somehow the uh the the relative outperformance

of the US and the absolute stagnation decline of the US they they're actually related things because uh the way the

conversation's grouped every time I say tell someone you know I'm thinking about leaving the country they'll they'll do what you you say and they'll say well

every place is worse and then that somehow distracts us from all the problems in this country and then we can't talk about what's what's uh what's

gone wrong in the US because you know everything is uh everything's so much worse you know well I think most people

know what's gone wrong but they don't know if they're on the side of the government that's currently in power they don't know how to criticize it they

don't know exactly what to say what should be done right and they're ideologically connected to this group being correct right so they try to do

mental gymnastics to try to support some of the things that are going on I think that's that's a part of the problem I don't think it's necessarily we don't

know what the problems are we we know what the problems are but we don't have Clear Solutions as to how to fix them

nor do we understand the real mechanisms of how they got there in the first place yeah I mean so there there are a lot

that are that are pretty obvious to to articulate and uh they're much easier

describe than than solved like we have a crazy crazy budget deficit yeah and

presumably you have to do one of three things um you have to raise taxes a lot you have to cut spending a lot or um

you're just going to keep borrowing money isn't there like some enormous amount of our taxes that just go to the

deficit it's it's not it's not that high but it's gone up a

lot and what is it what is it didn't I thought it was like 34% or something czy

it peaked at 3 point I want to say it

peaked at 3.1% of GDP which is you know

um maybe um 15 20% of the budget peed 3.1% of GDP in 1991 and then it went all

the way down to something like one and a half% in the mid-2010s and now it's

crept back up to 3.1 3.2% and so we are at all-time highs as a percentage of GDP

and the way to understand the basic math is the uh the debt went up a crazy

amount but the interest rates went down and from you know 2008 to 2021 for 13 years we basically had zero interest

rates with you know one brief blip under um Powell but it was basically zero rates and then you could have borrow way

more money and it wouldn't show up in servicing the debt because you just paid zero% interest on the t t bills and um

and the thing that's that's very dangerous seeming to me about the current fiscal situation is um the

interest rates have gone back to positive like they were in the 90s and early 2000s um uh mid 2000s and um and

it's just this incredibly large debt and so we now have a we now have a real runaway deficit problem but you know

people have been talking about this for 40 years and uh crying wool for 40 years so it's it's very hard for people to take it seriously most people don't even

understand what it means like when you say there's a deficit we owe money okay

to who how's that work um uh it's well it's

to yeah people who who bought uh who bought the bonds and it's you know it's a lot of it's to Americans some of them

are held by the Federal Reserve decent amount are held by by by foreigners at this point because uh you know it's it's

it's in some ways it's the opposite of the of the um trade current account deficits the US has been running these big current account deficits and and the

foreigners end up with way more dollars than they than they want to spend on American goods or services and so they have to reinvest them in the US you know

some some put it into houses or stocks but a lot of it just goes into into government debt so in in some ways it's

a function of the of the chronic trade imbalances chronic trade deficits well if you had supreme power if uh Peter

teal was the ruler of the world and you could fix this what would you do man I always find I always find that hypothetical it's it's a ridiculous

hypothetical you ridiculous hypotheticals you get ridiculous answers I want a ridiculous answer that's what I like but but what could be done like what could be done first of all what

could be done to mitigate it and what could be done to solve it you know I I think I think my I think my answers are probably all

in the in the you know in the in the very libertarian Direction so I it would be

sort of figure out ways to have smaller governments figure out ways you know you

know to um increase the age on Social Security means test Social Security so not everyone gets it just figure out

ways to to gradually dial back uh you know a lot of these government

benefits um and then that's you know that's insanely unpopular so it's it's completely unrealistic on that level

that bothers people that need Social Security I said means tested means tested so people who don't need it don't get it right so Social Security like

even if you're very wealthy I don't even know how it work Works do you still get it yeah basically anyone who pretty much

everyone gets it because it was or

originally um rationalized as a uh as a

um as sort of a pension system not as a welfare system and so the the fiction

was you pay social security taxes and then um you're entitled to get a pension

out in the form of Social Security right and um and because it was uh we told this fiction that it was a form of uh

there was a pension system instead of an intergenerational Ponzi scheme or something something like that um you

know the fiction means everybody gets paid Social Security because it's a pension system whereas if we were more honest and said it's you know it's just a welfare

system maybe you could you could start dialing uh you could you could you could probably rationalize in a lot of ways

and it's it's not related to how much you put into it right like how does Social Security work in terms it's partially I think it's partially related

so I think there is uh I'm not a total expert on this stuff but I think um I think there's some

guaranteed minimum you get and then um and then and then if you put more in you get somewhat more and then it's it's

capped at a certain amount and even that's that's why that's why Social Security taxes are capped at something

like you know $150,000 a year and then this is you know this is one of the this is one of the really big tax increase proposals

that's out there is to is to uncap it which would effectively be a 12 .4%

income tax hike you know oh wow all your income just to Social Security sure

because uh the the argument is the argu the the the sort of progressive left Democrat argument is that uh is that

it's you know why should you have a regressive Social Security tax why should you pay 12.4% or whatever the

Social Security tax is which half gets paid by by you half gets paid by your

employer but then it it's capped at like 140 150 50k some level like that and why

should be regressive where if you make 500k or a million k a year you pay zero tax on your marginal

income and that makes no sense if it's a welfare program if it's a if it's a retirement Savings Program and your your

payouts capped then you know if you you don't need to put in more then you get out well that's logical but there's not

a lot of logic going on with the way people are talking about taxes today like California just jacked their taxes

up to 14 what was it 144 something like that yeah 143 I think which is maybe

more yeah 149 something yeah you want more money for doing a terrible job and having more people leave for the first

time ever in like the history of the state yeah but it look it it gets away with it I know and uh and so well people

are forced with no choice what are you gonna do um it is it

is I mean I mean there are people at the margins who leave but uh but the state government still collect it's more and

more in revenues so it's you know you get I don't know you get 10% more revenues and 5% of the people leave you

still you still increase the amount of revenues you're getting it's uh it's it's it's inelastic enough that you you're actually able to increase the

Reven I mean this is sort of the the crazy thing about California is uh you know there there's always sort of a

right-wing or libertarian critique of California that you know it's it's such

a ridiculous place it it should just collapse um under its own Ridiculousness

and uh it doesn't quite happen you know um the macroeconomics on it are are

pretty good you know 40 million people the GDP is around four trillion it's about the same as Germany with 80

million or Japan with 125 million Japan has three times the population of California same GDP means onethird the

per capita GDP so there's some level on which you know California as a whole is working even though it doesn't work from

a governance point of view doesn't work for a lot of the people who live there and uh the the rough model I have for

how to think of California is that it's kind of like Saudi Arabia and you have a

crazy religion wokeism in California wahhabism in Saudi Arabia you know not

that many people believe it but it it distorts everything and then um and then you have like oil fields in Saudi Arabia

and you have the big tech companies in California and the oil pays for everything

and then you have a completely bloated inefficient government sector and uh and you have sort of all

sorts of distortions in the real estate market where uh people also make uh lots of money and sort of the government and

real estate are ways you redistribute the oil wealth or the uh you know the

the big Tech uh the big Tech money in in California and um and it's like it's

it's not the way you might want to design a system from scratch but it's it's pretty stable and people been saying Saudi Arabia is ridiculous it's

going to collapse any year now they've been saying that for 40 or 50 years but you know if you have a giant oil field you can pay for a lot of ridiculousness

I think that's that's the way to that's that's the way you have to think of California well the other thing is you're also there things about it that

are ridiculous but there's something about it that you know it um it doesn't naturally self-destruct overnight well there's a lot of Kick-Ass people there

and there's a lot of people that are still generating enormous amounts of wealth there and it's too difficult to just pack up and leave yeah I think it's

something like four of the eight or nine companies with Market capitalizations over a trillion dollars

are based in California so it's that's amazing it's Google Apple now

Nvidia meta um think yeah I think I think

broadcom's close to that and there's no ideal place to live

either it's not like California sucks so there's a place that's got it totally dialed in with all also that has an

enormous GDP also has an enormous population all there's not like one big

city that's really dialed in well it's there are there are things that that

work so I looked I looked at all the zero tax states in the US and uh and

it's always you don't I think the way you ask the question gets at it which is you don't live in a you know in theory a

lot of stuff happens on a state level but you don't live in a state you live in a city and so um if you're somewhat

biased towards living in at least a moderately sized city um okay I can

there are I think there are four states where there are no cities Alaska

Wyoming um South Dakota New Hampshire

there's zero tax but um no cities to speak of um and then you have um then

you have Washington state with Seattle where the weather is the worst in the

country you have um Nevada with Las Las Vegas which I'm not that big a fan of

and then that leaves three three zero tax states you have Texas which I like

as a state but I'm not that big a fan of Austin Dallas or Houston and I you know

it's a sort of um Houston is just sort of an oil town which is good if you're

in that business but otherwise not um Dallas has sort of a inferiority complex

to LA in New York you know just not not the healthiest attitude and

then um you know I don't know Austin's a government town and a college town and a wannabe hipster San Francisco town so

you know my my books are three strikes and you're you're kind of out too and then that leaves um that leaves

Nashville Tennessee which was and then uh or Miami South Florida and those those would be my two top choices

Miami's fun but I wouldn't want to live there it's a fun place to visit is a little too crazy a little too chaotic

little too cocaine fueled a little too party party party I think it's I think it's pretty I think it's pretty

segmented from the tourist the tourist strip from everything else it it probably is you

know there probably is something a little bit paradoxical about any place that gets lots of tourists

where um you know it's it's it's in some sense a Vaca there's some things that

are great about because so many tourists go but then in some sense it's um it creates a weird aesthetic because uh the

you know the day-to-day Vibe is that you don't you don't work and you're just having fun or something something like that right cuz so many people are going there just to do that and that's that's

probably a little bit off with the south Florida the south Florida thing but um

but I think it's um and then I think uh and then I think Nashville is is is also

sort of its own real place Nashville's great yeah so those those would be my those are the top two I I could live in

Nashville no problem yeah I'm probably always I'm always I'm always too uh you

know I fifth grade onward since you know

7077 I lived in California and uh and

and so I'm just a sucker for the weather and I think there is no place besides

Coastal California where you have really good weather year round in the US may maybe Hawaii's pretty good Coastal

California is tough to beat and um and you're two hours from the mountains and man it's like you know it's mid August here in Austin

this is just it's just brutal is it I I think so really that was too hot for you it was too hot for today's mild well what is it out there like 80 all right

85 96 96 do so much sauna that I literally

don't even notice it I'm outside for hours every day shooting arrows and I don't even notice

it well that's uh I I don't know if you're a representative of the average a I don't know but I think you get

accustomed to it to me it's so much better than too cold too cold you can die and I know you can die from the heat

but you probably won't especially if you have water you'll be okay but you could die from the cold Cold's real so really

cold places there's five months out of the Year where your life's in danger where you could do something wrong like if you live in Wyoming and you break

down somewhere and there's no one on the road you could die out there that's real you could die from exposure sure there's

probably some very deep reason there's been a net migration of people to the the west and the south in the US over

California can do no wrong as long as the Earth doesn't move you're good long as there's no tsunamis you're good it is

a perfect environment virtually year round it gets a little hot in the summer

but again Coastal not at all if you get an 80 degree day in Malu it's unusual you know it's wonderful you got a

beautiful Breeze coming off the ocean sun's out everybody's pretty and then and then it's yeah it's it's correlated

with confiscatory taxation they all it's all sort of a package deal well it's a scam you know they know you don't want to leave I didn't want to leave

California it's [ __ ] great I I I appreciate you left I always I always have the fantasy that if enough people like you leave it'll put pressure on them but it's it's never quite enough

never quite enough and it's not going to be it's too difficult for most people it was very difficult for me and I had a bunch of people working for me that were

willing to pack up and leave like young Jamie over there but we you know it was tricky you're you're taking your whole

business and my business is talking to people that's part of my business my other business is standup comedy so so you left during during Co or I left at

the very beginning as soon as they started locking things down I'm like oh these [ __ ] never let March April may0 in May I started looking at

houses cool that's when I came to Austin first

um I I end I got a place in Miami in September 2020 and um and spent the last

you know I've spent the last four winers there so I'm sort of always on the cusp of of uh moving to Florida hard hard to

get out of California um but the the thing that's gotten a lot harder about

moving relative to four years ago and you know I'd say I think my real estate purchases have generally not been not

been great over the years I mean they've done okay but certainly not um not the

way uh not the way I've um been able to um make money at all but uh with the one

exception was Miami bought it in September 2020 and probably you know

fast forward um four years it's up like

100% wow something like that and um and

uh and then but then paradoxically this also means it's it's gotten much harder

to move there or Austin or or any of these places you know if you um you know

if if uh if I relocated my office in La um the people who own houses okay you

have to you have to buy a place in Florida it costs twice as much as it did four years ago and then the interest rates have also doubled and so you get a

30-year mortgage you could have locked that in for 3% in

2020 now it's you know maybe 6 and a half 7% so the prices have doubled the

mortgages have doubled so it cost you four times as much to buy a house and so uh yeah so there was a moment where

people could move during covid and it's it's gotten dramatically harder relative to what it was four years ago well the

Austin real estate market went crazy and then it came back down a little bit it's in that down a little bit spot right now

where there's a lot of like high-end properties that are still for sale they can't move it's different you know there's not a lot of people moving here

now like there was in the boom cuz everything's open everywhere well I I I I I somehow think Austin was linked to

California and Miami was linked a little bit more to to New York and um it was a

little bit you know all these differences but um Austin was kind of

you know a big part of the move where people from Tech from California that moved um moved to Austin you know

there's a part of the Miami South Florida thing which was people from finance and New York uh New York City

that moved um moved to to Florida and the finance industry is less networked

on New York city so I think it is possible for people if you run a you know private Equity Fund or if you work

at a bank it's possible for some of those functions to easily be moved to to

a different state um the tech industry is cily networked on California like

there's probably some way to do it it's um it's uh it's not that

easy yeah it makes sense it it makes sense too it's just the sheer numbers I mean when you're talking about all those

corporations that are established and based in California there's so many they're so big just the sheer numbers of

human beings that live there and work there that are involved in Tech um sure

but if it wasn't if it wasn't as networked you know you could you could probably just move you know and maybe

these things are networked till they're not you know Detroit was very networked the car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades and decades and

Michigan got more and more mismanaged and people thought the network sort of protected them because you know the big three car companies were in Detroit but

then you had all the supply chains were also in Detroit and then eventually it was just so ridiculous people moved um

started moving the factories outside of that area and it sort of unraveled so that's you know it can also happen with

California it'll just take a lot that would be insane if they just abandon all the tech companies in California I mean just look at what happened at Flint

Michigan when all the auto factories pulled out well it's it's um look I think you can it's always there all

these paradoxical histories you know the the internet the point of the internet

in some sense was to eliminate the tyranny of place and that was sort of the idea and then one of the paradoxes

about the internet history of the internet was that the internet companies you know were you know were all you know

were all centered in um in California then yeah probably there have been

different different waves of um of how networked how how non- networked they

were I think uh I think probably

2021 uh sort of the the co moving away

from California the big thing in Tech was crypto um and um and crypto um had

this conceit of a you know alternate currency decentralized away from the central

banks but also the crypto companies the um crypto protocols you could do those from anywhere you could do them outside

the US you could do them from Miami and so crypto was something where um the

tech could naturally um move out of

California and and today probably the

the um I don't know the core Tech narative is completely flipped to

Ai and uh and if and then there's something about AI That's you know very centralized you know I always I had this

one liner years ago where it was you know if if we say that crypto is libertarian can we also say that AI is

communist or something like this where the you know the natural structure for an AI company looks like it's a big

company and then somehow the AI stuff is uh is feels like it's going to be

dominated by the the big tech companies in um in the San Francisco Bay

area and so that's the future of tech yeah the um

the the the scale the natural scale of the industry tells you that it's uh going to be extremely hard to get out of

you know out of the San Francisco Bay Area when you look to the Future and you

try to just make a just a guess as to how all this is going to turn out with

AI what do you think we're looking at over the next five years man I I think I should start by being modest in

answering that question saying that nobody has a clue right which is true

they which pretty much all the experts say you know I I would

say Let me let me do sort of a history I the Riff I always had on this was that

I can't stand any of the buzzwords and I felt AI you know there's all this big data Cloud Compu Computing there were

all these crazy buzzwords people had and they always were ways to sort of

abstract things and get away from um from uh from reality somehow and um we're not good ways of talking about

things and I thought AI was this incredible abstraction because it can mean the next generation of computers it can mean the last generation of

computers it can mean anything in between and if you think about the AI

discussion in the 2010s pre um open AI chat GPT and the the revolution of the

last 2 years but the 2010's AI discussion maybe it was so I'll start with the history before I get to the

future but the history of it was it was maybe anchored on two uh two visions of

what AI meant and one was um Nick Bostrom Oxford Prof who wrote This Book

uh super intelligence 2014 and it was

basically AI was going to be this super duper um intelligent thing way way

Godlike intelligence way smarter than any any human being and um and then

there was sort of the the I don't know the CCP Chinese Communist rebuttal the

Kaiu Lee book from 2018 AI superpowers I think subtitle something like the race

for AI between Silicon Valley and China or something like this and um it it was

sort of it defined AI as it was fairly

low Tech it was just surveillance um you know facial recognition technology um we

would just have this sort of totalitarian stalinist monitoring it didn't require very much Innovation it

just required that you apply things and basically the subtext was China is going to win because we have no ethical qualms

in China about um applying this this

sort of basic machine learning to uh to sort of measuring or controlling the the

population and those were sort of like say two

extreme um competing visions of of what AI would mean in the

in the 2010s and that sort of maybe were sort of the anchors of of the AI

debate and then um and then you know

what what happened in some sense with um

chat GPT in late 22 early

23 was um was that uh the achievement you you got you did not get super

intelligence it was not just surveillance Tech but it was you you actually got to the Holy

Grail of what people would have defined AI as from 1950 to 2010 for the previous

60 years before the 2010s people have always said AI the definition of AI is passing the touring test and the touring

test it it basically means that the computer can fool you into thinking that

it's a human being and um and um and it's a somewhat fuzzy test because you know obviously

you have an expert on the computer a non-expert you know it's you know does does it fool you all the time or some of

the time how good is it but to First approximation the touring test you know

we weren't even close to passing it in 2021 and then you know chat GPT

basically passes the touring test at least for like let's say an IQ 100 average person um it can uh it can um

it's passed the touring test and that was that was the Holy Grail that was the

Holy Grail of uh AI research for the previous 60 years and and so there's I know there's probably some psychological

or sociological history where we can say that this weird debate between Bostrom about super intelligence and Kaiu Le

about surveillance Tech was like this almost like psychological suppression

people had where they were not thinking they they lost track of the touring test of the Holy Grail of because it was

about to happen and it was such a significant such an important thing that you didn't even want to think about it so I'm tempted to give almost a

psychological repression theory of of

the 2010 debates but um be that as it

may the touring test gets uh gets passed

and that's yeah that's an extraordinary achievement and then you know may maybe um May and then you know where where

does it go from here there probably are ways you can

refi refine these it's still going to be you know a long time to apply it there

is a question there's this AGI discussion you know will we get

artificial general intelligence which is a hopelessly vague concept which you know general intelligence could be just

a generally smart human being so is that just a person with an IQ of

130 or is it super intelligence is it Godlike intelligence uh so it's sort of

an ambiguous thing um but I I keep thinking that uh maybe the AGI question

is less important than passing the touring test if if we got AGI if we got

let's say super intelligence if we got that would be interesting to Mr God because um you'd have a competi you'd

have competition for being God but um but surely the touring test is more important for us humans because it's

either a complement or substitute to humans and so it's yeah it it's going to rearrange the economic

cultural political structure of our society in extremely dramatic ways and and I think maybe what's already

happened is much more important than anything else that's going to be done and then it's just going to be a long

ways in applying it one one last thought the you know the the

um the analogy I'm always tempted to go to and it's these things are never historical analogies are never perfect

but it's it's that maybe Ai and

2023 24 is like it's like the internet in

1999 where on one level it's clear the internet's going to be big and get very

a lot bigger and it's going to dominate the economy it's going to rearrange the society in the 21st century and then at

the same time it was a complete bubble and um people had no idea how the

business models worked um you know almost everything blew up it it took you know it didn't take that

long in the scheme of things it took you know 15 20 years for it to become super

dominant but uh it didn't happen sort of in 18 months as people fantasized in in

1999 and uh and maybe maybe maybe what we have in AI is is is something like

this it's um figuring out how to actually apply it you know um in sort of

all these different ways is going to take something like two decades but but that doesn't distract from it being a really big deal it is a really

big deal and I think you're right about the during test I do you think that the lack of acknowledgement or the public

celebration or at least this like mainstream discussion like which I think should be everywhere that we've passed

the Turing test do you think it's connected to the fact that this stuff accelerates so rapidly that even though

we've essentially breach this new territory it we still know that chp5 is is going to be better GPT 6 is going to

be insane and then they're working on these right now and that and the change is happening so quickly we're almost a

little reluctant to acknowledge where we're at yeah um you

know I I have I've often I've you know probably for 15 years or so often been

on the side that there isn't that much progress in science or Tech or not as

much as Silicon Valley likes to claim and um and even on the AI level I think

it's a massive technical achievement it's still an open question you know is it actually going to lead to much higher

living standards for everybody you know the internet was a massive achievement how much it it raise people's living

standards uh much much trickier question

so um so I I I but um but in in this

world where not much has happened one of the paradoxes of a of an era of relative

Tech stagnation um is that when something does happen we don't even know how to process it so you know I think I

think Bitcoin was a i it was a big invention we can debate with it was good or bad but it was a pretty big deal and

it was um systematically underestimated

for at least you know the first uh um 10 11 years and you know you could you

could trade it it went up smoothly for 10 11 years it didn't get repriced all at once because uh we're in a world

where nothing big ever happens and um and so we we have no way of processing it when something pretty big

happens the internet was pretty big in 99 Bitcoin was moderately big internet was really big Bitcoin was moderately

big and I'd say um passing the Turing test is really big it's on the same

scale as the internet and uh and because our our lived experien is that so

little has felt like it's been changing for the last few decades we're we're probably underestimating it it's

interesting the say that so little we feel like so little has changed CU if

you're a person how old are you um same age as you were born 1967 so in our age

we've seen all the change right we saw the uh end of the Cold War we saw

answering machines we saw VHS tapes then we saw the internet and then where we're at right now which is like this bizarre

moment in time where people carry the internet around with them in their pocket every day and these super sophisticated computers that are

ubiquitous everybody has one there's incredible technology that's being ramped up every year they're getting better all the time and now there's AI

there's AI on your phone you could access chat GPT and a bunch of different programs on your phone and I think

that's an insane change I I think that that's one of the most especially with the use of social media it's one of the

most bizarre changes I think our culture is ever the most it can be it can be a

big change culturally or or politically um but uh the yeah the kinds of

questions I I'd ask is how do you measure it economically does it how much

does it change GDP how much do it change

productivity um and um and certainly um

the story I I would generally tell for the last 50 years since the 1970s early

70s is that we've been not absolute stagnation we in an era of relative

stagnation where there has been um very limited progress in the world of atoms

the world of physical things um um and uh there has been um a lot of progress

in the world of bits information computers internet mobile internet you know now now ai what are you referring

to when you're saying the the world of physical things um you know it's any um

it's well if we had defined technology if we were sitting here in 1967 the year

we were born and had a discussion about technology what technology would have meant would it would have meant

computers it would have also meant Rockets it would meant supersonic airplanes it would have meant um new

medicines it would have meant the Green Revolution in agriculture maybe

underwater cities um you know it it sort of had BEC and it because technology

simply gets defined as that which is changing that which is progressing and so there's progress on all these fronts

T today last 20 years when you talk about technology you're normally just talking about information technology

technology has been reduced to meaning computers and that tells you that the structure of progress has been weird

there's been this narrow cone a very intense progress around the world of bits around the world of computers and

then all the other areas have been relatively stagnant we're not moving any faster you know the Concord got

decommissioned in 2003 or whenever um and then with all the low Tech airport security measures it takes even longer

to fly to get through all all of them from from from one city to the next you know the highways have gone backwards because they're more traffic jams we

haven't figured out ways around those so they're sort of we're literally moving

slower than we were 40 or 50 years ago

um and um and then yeah some uh and that's that's sort of the uh that's sort

of the um and then you know the and then of course um there's also a sense in

which uh these the screens and the devices you know have have this effect distracting us from this so you know

when you're you know riding a 100 year old Subway New York City and you're looking at your iPhone you can you can

look at wow this is this cool new Gadget but you're also being distracted from the fact that your lived environment

hasn't changed you know in a 100 years and and and so there's yeah there's a

question how important is this world of bits versus versus the world of ad Adams you know I would say as human beings

we're physically embodied in a material world and so I I I would always say this world of atams is pretty important and

when that's pretty stagnant you know there's a lot of stuff that that doesn't make sense I I was an undergraduate at

Stanford late 80s and at the time um in retrospect

every engineering area would have been a bad thing to go into you know mechanical engineering chemical engineering all

these engineering skills where you were tinkering and trying to do new things because these things turned out to be stuck they were regulated couldn't come

up with new things to do nuclear engineering Aero Astro engineering people already knew those were really bad ones to go into they were you know

outlawed you weren't going to make any progress in new nuclear reactor designs or stuff like that um electrical engineering which was the one that's

sort of adjacent to making semiconductors that one was still okay and then the only field that uh was

actually going to progress a lot was computer science and um and again you know it's it's been very powerful but

that was not the felt sense in the 1980s in the 1980s computer science was this

ridiculous inferior subject um you know I I always the the linguistic cut is always when when people use the word

science I'm in favor of science I'm not in favor of Science and quotes and when it's always a tell that it's not real

science and so when we call it climate science or political science or social science um you know you're just sort of

making it up and you have an inferiority complex to real science which something physics or chemistry and computer science was in the same category as

social science or political science it was it was a fake field for people who

found electrical engineering or math way too hard and um um and and sort of

dropped out of out of the real the real science and real um real engineering Fields you don't feel that climate

science is a real science it's it is

um it's it's um

well let me it's i i i there's several different things one could say it's

uh it's possible climate change is happening it's possible we don't have great accounts of why that's going on so

I'm not I'm not questioning any of those things but uh but how scientific it is

um I I don't think um I don't think it's it's a place where we have really vigorous debates you know maybe the

climate is increasing because of carbon dioxide emissions temperatures are going up maybe it's methane maybe it's people are eating too much steak it's the cows

flatulating or and you have to measure you how how much is methane a greenhouse gas versus versus carbon dioxide I don't think they're I don't think they're

rigorously doing that stuff scientifically and I think the fact that it's called climate science tells you

that it's more dogmatic than than than anything that's truly science should be why doesn't Dogma doesn't mean it's wrong but but why is the fact that it's

called climate science mean that it's more dogmatic because if you said nuclear science you wouldn't question it right it's yeah but no one calls it

nuclear science they call it nuclear engineering because I'm just the only the only thing is I just making I'm just making neing science that is

legitimately science well this point people say computer science has worked but right in the 1980s all I'm saying is

it was in the same categories let's say social science political science it was it was a it was a tell that the people doing it kind of deep down knew they

they weren't doing real science well there's certainly ideology that's connected to climate science and then

there's certainly corporations that are invested in this uh this Prospect of green energy and the concept of green

energy and they're profiting off of it and pushing these different things whether it be electric car mandates or

whatever it is like California I think they it's 30 20 35 they have a mandate that all new vehicles have to be electric which is hilarious when you're

connected to a grid that can't support the electric cars it currently has after

they said that within a month or two Gavin new asked people to not charge

their Teslas because it was summer and the grid was [ __ ] yeah look it's it it it was all linked into all these

ideological projects in all these ways and uh there you know there's there's an

environmental project which is you know and and maybe maybe it shouldn't be scientific you know there's you know the hardcore environmentalist argument is we

only have one planet and we don't have time to do science if we if we have to do rigorous science and you can prove

that we're overheating it'll be too late and um and so if you're a hardcore environmentalist you know you don't want

to have as high a standard of science yeah my my intuition is certainly when when you go away from that you end up

with things that are too dogmatic too ideological may maybe it doesn't even work even if the planet's getting warmer

you know maybe climate science is is not like my my question is is car like maybe methane is a

worse um is is is it more dangerous greenhouse gas than uh carbon dioxide

we're not we're not even capable of measuring that well we're also ignoring certain things like regenerative Farms

that sequester carbon that and then you have people like Bill Gate saying that planting trees to deal with carbon is

ridiculous it's a ridiculous way to do it like how is that ridiculous is they literally turn carbon dioxide into

oxygen it is their food their food that's what the food of plants is that's that's what powers the the whole plant

life and the way we have the symbiotic relationship with them like and the more carbon dioxide is the greener it is

which is why it's Greener Today on Earth than it has been in a hundred years sure these are all facts that are

inconvenient to people that have a very specific narrow window of how to approach this sure although you know

there probably are ways to steal man the other side too where um where

maybe maybe um you know the the original 1970s you know I think the manifesto that's

always very interesting from the other side was this uh book by the club of

Rome 1972 the limits of growth and it's you can't have you we need to head

towards a society in which there's zero% there's very limited growth because if you have unlimited growth you're going

to run out of resources if you don't run out of resources you'll hit a pollution constraint but the um in the 1970s it

was um you're going to have overpopulation um you're going to run out of oil we had the oil shocks um and

then um and then by the 90s it it sort of morphed into more of the pollution problem with uh with carbon dioxide

climate change other other environmental things but uh but there is sort of um

you know it's you know there's been some you know some improvement in in oil carbon fuels with fracking things like

this in Texas it's um it's not at the scale that's been enough to uh um you

know give an American standard of living to the whole planet and we consume a 100

million barrels um of oil um you a day globally

um maybe fracking can add 10% 10 million to that if everybody on this planet has an American standard of living it's

something like three 300 400 million barrels of oil and I don't I don't think

that's there so that's that's kind of I I always wonder whether that was the that was the real environmental

argument is we can't have an American standard of living for the whole planet

we somehow can't justify this degree of

inequality and um and therefore you know we have to figure out ways to dial back

and you know tax the carbon restrict it and uh and maybe you know maybe that's

there's some sort of a malthusian calculus that's more about resources than about

pollution um how much of that could the the the demand for oil could be mitigated by

nuclear uh it you Pro you probably could

mitigate it a lot there's there's a question why the why the nuclear thing

has gone so wrong it's um especially if you if you have El Vehicles right you know it's uh um combustion engine is

probably hard to get nuclear to work but if you um if you shift to electric vehicles you can you can charge them you

know your Tesla cars at night um and that that would seemingly work um and there's definitely yeah there's

definitely a history of energy where it was always in the direction of you know

more intense use it went from wood to Coal to oil which is a more compact form

of energy and in a way takes up less of the environment and then if we move from

oil to uranium that's even you know it it's even smaller and so in a sense the

smaller the more dense the energy is the less of the environment it takes up and

when we go back when we go from oil to natural gas which takes up more space and from natural gas to solar or wind we

have to you know you have to pollute the whole environment by putting up windmills everywhere or you have to you know you know you have to cover the whole desert with solar pan that is a

good way to look at it it is a form of pollution and so um and so there was a way there was a way that nuclear was

supposed to be the uh the the energy mode of the the 21st century and then yeah there there all these there these

historical questions why did it why did it get stopped why did we not uh why did

we not go down that route the um you know the the standard explanation of why

it stopped um was that uh it was um there were all these dangers we had three mile

on 1979 you know Chernobyl and um in 1986

and then the Fukushima one in Japan I think 2011 and uh you had these sort of

you had these various act accidents um my alternate theory on why uh why

nuclear energy really stopped is that it um it was um it was

sort of dystopian or even apocalypse itic because it turned out that it was

all um it turned out to be very dual use if you build nuclear power

plants um uh it's it's only sort of one step away from uh building nuclear

weapons and uh and it turned out to be a lot trickier to u to separate those two

things out than it looked and I think the you know the signature moment was 1974 or 75 when India gets the nuclear

bomb and I the US I believe had transferred the nuclear reactor technology to India we thought they

couldn't weaponize it and then it turned out it was pretty easy to weaponize and then the and then sort of the

geopolitical problem with uh with

nuclear power was you either you know um you need a double standard where

we have nuclear power in the us but we don't allow other countries to have nuclear power because the US gets to keep its nuclear weapons

we don't let 100 other countries have nuclear weapons and this that's an extreme double standard probably a

little bit hard to

justify um or um or you need some kind

of really effective Global governance where you have a one world government that regulates all this stuff which

doesn't sound that good either and uh and then sort of the

compromise was just to um to um regulate it so much that uh you know maybe the

the nuclear plants got grandfathered in but it became too expensive to build new ones Jesus like even China which is the

country where they're building the most nuclear power plants they've built way less than people expected a decade ago

because um you know they they don't trust they don't trust their own designs

and so they have to copy the over safety overprotected designs from the west and the nuclear plants nuclear power costs

too much money it's cheaper to do coal wow so um so you know I'm not get

the numbers exactly right but if you look at what percent of Chinese electricity was nuclear it wasn't that

high it was like maybe four five% in 2013 2014 and the percent hasn't gone up in 10 years because you know they maybe

doubled the amount of electricity they Ed maybe they doubled the nuclear but the relative percentage is still it's still a pretty small part of the mix

because it's just more expensive when you have these you over safety designed

reactors there probably ways to build small reactors um that that that are that are way cheaper but then you still

have this you still have this dual use thing you know do do you create plutonium do you you know are are there

ways you can create a pathway to building more nuclear weapons and if

there was Innovation if nuclear engineering had gotten to a point where you know let's say there wasn't Three

Mile Island or Chernobyl didn't happen do you think that it would have gotten to a much more efficient and much more

effective version by now well my my understanding is there are we we have way we have way more efficient designs
