we have small you you can do small reactor designs which which are you don't need this giant containment

structure so it costs much less per kilowatt hour of of electricity you produce so I I think we have those

designs they're they're just not allowed and then but then I think the problem is that um if you were able to build them

in all these countries all over the world you still have this dual use problem right and again my alternate history of what really went wrong with

nuclear power it wasn't three mland it wasn't Chernobyl that's the that's the

official story the real story was India getting the bomb wow that makes sense

that completely makes sense gez Louise and then this is you know this is always

you know this is always the question about uh um there's always a big picture

question people ask me you know uh you know if I'm right about this picture of you know this slowdown in Tech this the

sort of stagnation in many many dimensions and then there's always a question you know wh why did this happen

and um and my copout answer is always uh why questions are

overdetermined um because you know um it can be there are multiple reasons and so

it could be why could be we became a more feminized risk-averse Society could be that uh the education system worked

less well could be that we were just out of ideas the easy ideas have been found the hard ideas the cupboard Nature's cupboard was Bare the low hanging fruit

had been picked so that it can be overdetermined but I think I think one

dimension that's not to be underrated

for the Science and Tech stagnation was

that uh an awful lot of Science and Technology had this dystopian or

apocalyptic uh Dimension and uh and probably what happened at you know Los Alamos in

1945 and then uh with with the thermonuclear weapons in the early 50s

um it took a while for it to really seep in but it had this sort of delayed

effect where you know maybe maybe a a stagnant World in which the physicists

don't get to do anything and they have to putter around with Dei and um you're

not you know um but uh you don't build weapons that blow up the world anymore

you know is that a is that a feature or a bug and so the stagnation was sort of was sort of like this this response and

so it sucks that we've lived in this world for 50 years where a lot of stuff

has been inert but um if we had a world that was still accelerating on all these

Dimensions with SuperSonics and Hypersonic planes and Hypersonic weapons and you know modular nuclear reactors

maybe we wouldn't be sitting here and the whole world would have already blown up and so we're we're in that we're in the stagnant path of the Multiverse

because it had it had this partially protective thing even though in all these other ways I feel it's it's it's deeply deranged our society that's a

very interesting perspective and it makes a lot of sense it really does and particularly the Dual use thing with

nuclear power and especially Distributing that to other countries when you talk about the stagnation in

this country like I don't know how much you follow this whole UAP nonsense I know we met what was that guy's name at

your place the uh the guy who did Chariots of the Gods oh fond Anakin yes yeah yeah you you you didn't you thought

he was too crazy you you like Hancock but you don't like fond danin H I didn't

think he's too crazy he just willfully in my opinion ignores evidence that

would show that some of the things that he's saying have already been solved and I think

his his hypothesis is all related to this concept that we have been visited and

that that's how all these things were built and that this technology was brought here from another world and I

think he's very ideologically locked into these ideas and I think a much more

compelling idea is that there were very Advanced cultures for some reason 10,000

years ago whatever it was whatever the year was where they they built some of

the insane structures it's a 45 100 years ago they roughly think the

pyramids were built like what whatever the [ __ ] was going on there I think those were human beings I think those

were human beings in that place in that time and I think they had some sort of very sophisticated technology that was

lost and things can get lost things can get lost in cataclysms things can get

lost in they can get lost in disease and famine and all there's all sorts of War all sorts of reasons the burning of the

Library of Alexandria there's all sorts of ways that technology gets lost forever and you can have today someone

living in Los Angeles in the most sophisticated high-tech Society the world has ever known while you still

have people that live in the Amazon that live in the same way that they've lived for thousands of years so those things

can happen in the same Planet at the same time and I think while the rest of the world was essentially operating at a

much lower vibration there were people in Egypt that were doing some extraordinary things um I don't know how they got the information maybe they did

get it from visitors maybe they did but there's no real compelling evidence that they did I think there's much more

compelling evidence that a cataclysm happened um when you look at the younger dras impact Theory it's all entirely

based on science it's entirely based on core samples and meridium content and and also massive changes in the

environment over a very short period of time particularly the melting of the ice caps in North America and just craters

all around the world that we know something happened roughly 11,000 years

ago and probably again 10,000 years ago I think it's a regular occurrence on this planet that things go sideways and

there's massive natural disasters and I think that it's yeah there there's the

Bron age civilization collapse somewhere

in the mid 12th century BC and um and probably the um you know in some ways

the the one in which we have the best history is the fall of the Roman Empire which was obviously sure the culmination

of the classical world and uh it somehow it's somehow extreme extremely unravel

so my yeah I think I think my my view on

it is probably somewhere between yours

and the um the fond Anakin no not fond

Anakin I'm more on the uh more on the

more on the uh Pro uh the other side let me let me let me try to Define

why this agree on why this is so important today this is not just of antiquarian

interest and the reason it matters today is because the alternative you know if if if if you

say civilization has seen great Rises and Falls it's gone through these great

Cycles um you know may maybe the Bronze Age civilizations were very Advanced but someone came up with iron weapons so

there was just one dimension where they progressed but then everything else they could destroy and so um uh or you know

the fall of the Roman Empire was again this you know pretty cataclysmic thing where there were diseases and you know

and then there were political things that unraveled but uh somehow you know was was a massive regression for you

know four five 600 years into the into the Dark Ages and um the um the the sort

of naive the progressive things always just

got monotonically better and there's sort of this revisionist purely Progressive history where even the Roman

Empire didn't Decline and even you know this one one one sort of stupid way to

quantify this stuff is with pure demographics and so it's the question

how many people lived in the past and um and the Rises and Falls of civilization

story is there were more people who lived in the Roman Empire because it was more advanced it could support a larger population and then the population

decline you know city of Rome maybe had a million people at its peak and then by

you know I don't know 650 ad it's maybe it's down to 10,000 people or less you

have this complete collapse in population and then um and then the the sort of alternate purely Progressive view is the

population has always just been monotonically increasing because it's a measure of how in some sense things in

aggregate have have always been getting better so I am I am definitely on your

side that population had great Rises and

Falls civilizations had great Rises and

Falls um um and so that part of it I I I

agree with you or even you know some variant of what Hancock or fundana can

say uh the the the place where I would say I

think things are different is I don't think I don't think um and and and and and therefore it seems possible

something could happen to our civilization that's that's always the upshot of it if if it had been monotonically always progressing then

there's nothing we should worry about nothing can possibly go wrong and then

certainly certainly the thing um the the

the sort of alternate Hancock fond danin um Joe Rogan history of the world uh

tells us is that uh we shouldn't take our civilization for granted there's there things that can go really hawi I I

agree with that the one place where I I is I think I do think our civilization

today is on some Dimensions way more advanced than any of these past civilizations were I don't think any of

them had nuclear weapons I don't think any of them had um you know

spaceships um or or anything like that and uh and

so the failure mode is likely to be be be somewhat different from from these

These past ones yeah that makes sense um I think uh technology progressed in a

different direction that's what I think I think it structural Technology Building Technology had somehow or

another achieved levels of competence that's not available today when you look

at the construction of the great perment of Giza there's 2,300,000 stones in it

there the whole thing points to do north south east and west it's an incredible achievement the the stones some of them

were moved from a quarry that was 500 miles away through the mountains they have no idea how they did it massive Stones the ones inside the king's chamber where they like the biggest ones

are like 80 tons it's crazy the whole thing's crazy like how did they do that like whatever they did they did without

machine supposedly they did without um the the use of uh the combustion engine they didn't have electricity and yet

they were able to do something that stands the test of time not just so you could look at it you know like you can go to the

Acropolis and see the Parthenon it's gorgeous it's it's amazing it's incredible but I can understand how people could have built it the pyramids

is one of those things you just look at you go what the [ __ ] was going on here what was going on here and none of these people are still around you you have

this strange culture now that's entirely based around you know you have Cairo and

an enormous population of visitors right which is a lot of it people just going

to St these relics what what was going that those people were so much more

advanced than anyone anywhere else in the world yeah I would I I I'm not sure I would anchor on the technological part

but I think I think the the piece that is very hard for us to comprehend is what motivated them culturally well how

did they do it physically why why did they do it why why were you motiv so why but also how how is a big one because

that it's really difficult to solve there's no traditional conven explanations for the construction the movement of the stones the amount of

time that it would taken if you move 10 stones a day I believe it takes 664 years to make one of those pyramids so how many people were involved how long

did it take how'd they get them there how' they figure out how to do it how come the shittier pyramids seem to be

dated later like what what was going on in that particular period of time where

they figured out how to do something so extraordinary that even today 4,500 years later we stare at it and we

go I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] they did I I haven't studied it carefully enough I'll I'll Trust you

that it's very hard I think the the I think the I would say the the real mystery is why were they motivated and

it's because you can't live in a pyramid it's just it was just the afterlife of the Pharaoh there's some debate about that Christopher Dunn as an engineer who

believes that it was some sort of a power plant he's got this very bizarre theory that there was a chamber that exists if you can see you see the

structure of the pyramid the inside of it there's a chamber that's Subterranean and he believes this Subterranean

chamber was pounding on the surface of the of the earth and of the walls of the

thing creating this very specific vibration they had shafts that came down into the Queen's chamber these shafts

they would pour chemicals into these shafts and then there was limestone at the end of it this is all his theory not mine um the end of it there was this

Limestone which is permeable right so the Limestone which is porous these gases come through and creates this

hydrogen that's inside of this chamber then there are these shafts inside the king's chamber that

are they're they're getting uh energy from space you know gamma rays and all the [ __ ] from space and that it's going

through these Chambers which are very specifically designed to Target this these gases and put them into this chamber where they would interact with

this energy and he believes it's enough to create electricity man my it's a crazy Theory but look I'm always I'm

always too uh too fast to buk all these things but um like my just coming back to our earlier conversation it it sound

it it must have been a crazy power print to have a containment structure much bigger than a nuclear reactor yeah well it's ridiculous but it's also a

different kind of Technology right if nuclear technology was completely not on the table they didn't understand atoms

at all but they did understand that there's rays that come from space and that you could somehow harness the

energy of these things with specific gases and through some method con convert that into some form of

electricity but it if it takes so much power to put all these rocks on the

pyramid you have to always look at how efficient the power plant is so um so it

can't just be some it has to be like the the craziest reaction ever to justify such a big containment structure because

even nuclear power plants don't work economically barely work it well they didn't do a lot of them you know they

only did this one in Giza and then there was other pyramids that he thinks had different functions that were smaller

but the whole purpose of it is or the whole point of it is we we don't know what the [ __ ] it is we don't know why

they did it we have uh a group of new archaeologists that are looking at it from a completely different Theory they're not looking at it like it's a

tomb the established archaeologists have insisted that this is a tomb for the Pharaoh the newer archaeologists established archaeologists are looking at it and considering whether or not

there were some other uses for this thing and one of them is the concept of the par I'm

always I don't know if this is an alternate history Theory but I I'm

always into the James Frasier golden B Renee

Gerard violence sacred history where um you know you

have always this question about um the

origins of monarchy and kingship and um

the the sort of Gerard Frasier intuition

is um

that uh it's something like um it is

something like if um if every King is a kind of living God then uh we have to

also believe the opposite that maybe every God is a dead or murdered King and

that uh that somehow societies were organized around scapegoats the

scapegoats were um you know there was sort of a crisis in the archaic

Community it got blamed on a scapegoat the scapegoat was attributed all these

powers and then at some point the scapegoat before he gets executed figures out a way to postpone his

execution and turn the power into something real and so there's sort of this this very um weird adjacency

between mon the Monarch and the scapegoat and uh and then you know I don't know the sort of Riff on the would

be that the first pyramid did not need to be invented it was just the stones

that were thrown on a victim and then it somehow and that that's the original the

original stones that were thrown on a victim a community Stones a victim to death tribe runs after a victim you

Stone him to death you throw stones on the victim that's how you create the first Tomb H and then um and then as it

gets more complicated you create a tomb that's two million stones and and you get a you get

a pharaoh you get a pharaoh who figures out a way to postpone his own execution

or something like this I I think there's um I'm going to blank on the name of this ritual but I believe in old in in

the old Egyptian kingdoms which were sort of around the time of the Great

Pyramids or even before um there it was

something like um in the 30th year of the reign of the

Pharaoh the Pharaoh gets transformed

into a living God and um and then um

this perhaps dates to a time where um in the 30th year of the pharaoh's Reign the

Pharaoh would get ritually sacrificed or or killed and you have you know you have all these societies where the Kings

lived were allowed to rule for an a lot of time where you you know you you become king and you you draw the number

of Pebbles out of a base and that corresponds to how many years was this Jamie the said Festival HEB said

Festival of tale was an ancient Egyptian ceremony that celebrated the continued rule of pharaoh the name was taken from

the name of the Egyptian wolf God one of whom's name was whip this is what I'm talking about or said the less formal

Feast name the Feast of the tale is to yeah next paragraph is the one to start okay no that that one right there the

the ancient Festival might perhaps have been instituted to replace a ritual of murdering a pharaoh who was unable to continue to rule effectively because of

age or condition interesting interesting so you can't kill him now and then eventually said festivals were Jubilee several had

thrown for 30 years and then every 3 to four years after that so when it becomes Unthinkable to kill the Pharaoh the

Pharaoh gets turned into a living God before that the Pharaoh gets murdered

and then gets worshiped as a dead Pharaoh or distant God that's interesting but it still doesn't solve

the engineering puzzle the engineering puzzle is the biggest one like how did they do that well the one the one I'm focusing on is the motivational puzzle

even if you have all the motivation in the world if you want to build a structure that's insane to build today and you're doing it 4,500 years ago

we're dealing with a massive puzzle I I think I think I think the motivational part's the harder one to solve if if if

you can figure out the motivation you'll you'll you'll figure out a way to organize the whole society and if you can figure out if you can get the whole

society working on it you can probably do it but don't you think that his grasp on of power was in Peril in the first

place which is why they decided to come up with this idea of turning them into a living God so to to have the amount of

resources and power and then the engineering and then the understanding

of whatever methods they use to shape and move these things well this is

always the um this is always the anthropological debate between voler the

enlightenment thinker of the 18th century and durkheim the 19th century

Anthropologist and uh voler believes that um Rel religion originates as a

conspiracy of the priests to maintain power and so politics comes first the

politicians invent religion um and then durkheim says the causation the other

way around that somehow religion came first and then politics somehow came out

of it now of course you know once the politics comes out of it um you know the the priests the religious authorities

have political power they figure out ways to manipulate it things like this

but uh but I I find you know I find the durkheim story far more plausible than

the volar one I think the religious categories are are primary and the the political categories are are are

secondary so you think the religious the religion came first but what about if we emanated from tribal societies tribal

societies have always had leaders when you have leaders you're going to have dissent you're going to have challenges you're going to have politic and you have people negotiating to try to

maintain power keep power keep everything organized that's the origin of politics correct

uh you know I I I think that's a that's a whitewashed Enlightenment rationalist description of the origin of politics yeah what do you think the origin of

politics is I think it's far more vile than that you know what you're what you're giving me well it's very vile the control and power and maintaining power

involves murder and sabotage well that okay that's more like it but what you what what what what you gave me a minute

ago sounds more like a social contract theory in which people sit down negotiate and have you know a nice legal

chitchat to drop the social contract that is a complete fiction yeah I don't think that I think that there was

probably various levels of Civility that were achieved when Agriculture and when

establishments were constructed that were near resources where they didn't have to worry as much about food and water and

things along those lines things probably got a little bit more civil but I think that the origins of it are like the origins of all human conflict it's

filled with murder well I think at the beginning was Madness and murder yeah Madness and murder and and I don't

know I don't I don't know if it got I don't know if it got that much more rational I don't know if it's that

much more rational today well so in some ways it's not right this again this again back to the

you know the the progressive conception are we you know are we really have we really progressed how much have we

really progressed from from that but but uh but yeah I my my uh my version would

be that it was you know it was much more

um um it was organized around you know acts of uh Mass violence like maybe

maybe you externalize it onto you know a Mastadon or hunting some big animal or something like this but uh but the real

problem of violence you know it wasn't external it was mostly internal it was

it was violence with people who were near you proximate to you um it wasn't

even natural CL cataclysms or other tribes it was it was uh it was sort of

um much more uh the internal stuff and um it's very different I think the the

human situation is somehow very very different from something like I don't know an ape primate hierarchy where you

know in an ape context you have an alpha male um you know he's the strongest and there's some sort of natural dominance

and you don't need to have a fight to the death typically because you know who's the strongest and you don't need

to um push it all the way in a human context it's always possible for two or

three guys to gang up on the alpha male so uh so it's uh it's somehow the

culture is more important you know and if they can talk to each other and you get language and then they can coordinate and they can gang up on on

the leader and then you have to stop them from gting up on the leader and how how do you do that and so the there's

some sort of radical difference between a you know a human and a let's say an um

a prehuman world have you seen chimp Empire no chimp Empire is a fascinating

documentary series on Netflix where these scientists had been embedded with this tribe of chimpanzees for decades

and so because they were embedded they had very specific rules you has to maintain at least 20 yards from you and any of the chimps no food you can never

have food and don't look them in the eyes and as long as you do that they don't feel you're a threat and they think of you as a natural part of their

environment almost like you don't exist they and they behave completely naturally well it shows in that that

sometimes it's not the largest strongest one and that some chimps form bonds with other chimps and they form coalitions

and they do have some sort of politicking and they do help each other they groom each other they do specific things for each other and then one of

the things that happens also they get invaded by other chimps and that chimps leave and they go on patrol and other chimps gang up on them and kill them and

they try to fight and battle over resources so it's not nearly as cut and dry as the strongest chimp prevails

because one of the chimps that was dominant was an older chimp and he was smaller than some of the other chimps but he had formed a coalition with all

these other chimps and they all respected him and they all knew that they would be treated fairly and being treated fairly is a very important thing

with chimpanzees they get very jealous if they think that things are not fair which is why that guy was attacked and

you know that guy who had a um pet chimpanzee he brought it a birthday cake the other chimps weren't getting a piece

of the cake and they someone had [ __ ] up and left a door open they got out and mauled this guy because he didn't give

them some of the cake yeah so I I find all of that quite plausible but I think

both of us can be correct so there's some the the the true story of harmonization of how we became humans

there's a way to tell it where it's continuous with our animal past and where it's just you know there's things

like this with the chimpanzees or the baboons or you know um other primates

and then um there is a part of the story that I think is also more discontinuous

um and um you know my my judgment is we probably you know in a in a darwinian

context we always stress the continuity um you know I'm I'm always a little bit the contrarian and so um you I Believe

In Darwin's theory but uh I think uh I think uh we should also be skeptical of

ways it's too dogmatic and uh and Darwin's theories make us gloss over the

discontinuities and I think you know the one one type of happen overnight but one

type of Fairly dramatic discontinuity is that um you know is that humans have something like language and even though you know chimpanzees probably I don't

know they have an IQ of 80 or they're pretty they're pretty smart but but when

you don't have a rich symbolic system um that that leads to sort of a very very

different kind of structure and and there's something about uh um uh

language and the kind of coordination that allows and the ways that it forces you to it enables you to coordinate on

violence and then it encourages you to channel violence in certain sacred

religious directions um uh I think uh creates a you know something radically different about human society we're you

know we differ you know we we tell humans tell each other stories um a lot of the stories are not true true they're

myths but uh that's that is a that's I think that's an some some sort of a very

important difference from uh from even our closest uh uh uh primate uh primate

relatives um but you know this is again this is sort of like another way of getting at

what's uh so crazy about uh chat GPT and passing the touring test because if we

had sat here two years ago and you asked me you know what what is the distinctive feature of a human being what makes

someone a human and you know how and in a way that differs from everybody else

um you know it's not perfect but my go-to answer would been language you're you know you're threeyear old you're an

80y old you know just about all humans can speak languages just about all

non-humans cannot speak languages it's this it's this binary thing and then that's that's sort of a way of telling

us again why why passing the touring test was way more important than super intelligence or anything else yeah I

could see that I don't want go back to that tangent no it's a good tangent great keep tangent and off have fun it's great

um do you think what what do you think the factor was there's a lot of debate about this like the factor was that separated us from these animals and why

we became what we became because we're so vastly different than any other primate like so what do you think took place like the doubling of the human

brain size over a period of 2 million years is one of the greatest mysteries in the entire fossil record we don't know what the [ __ ] happened there's a

lot of theories the throwing arm cooking meat there's a lot of theories but we we

really have no idea well again if I if I let me do sort of linguistic riff I

think um Aristotelian darwinian biology

Aristotle you always differ things by put them in categories and and uh um man

I think the line Aristotle has is something man differs from the other

animals in his greater aptitud ude for

imitation and um and and I would say uh it that um we are

these giant imitating machines and of course the darwinian Riff on this is you

know to imitate is to ape and um and so we differ from the AP we're more aplike

than the Apes we are far better at aping each other than the apes are and um and

that uh to you know a first cut I would say our brains are giant imitation machines that's how you learn language

as a kid you imitate your parents uh and that's how culture gets transmitted but

then um there are a lot of dimensions of imitation that uh that are also very dangerous because um it's not imitation

doesn't just happen on this symbolic linguistic level it's also you imitate

things you want you want a banana I want a banana you want a blue ball I can have

a red ball I want a blue ball because you have a blue ball and um and and so there's something about

imitation that um you know creates

culture um you know that uh um that is incredibly important

pedagogically learning you know it's how you master something how you know in all these different ways and then um and

then a lot of it has this uh has this incredibly conflictual Dimension as well

and uh and then there's yes so I think I think that was sort of core to

the things that are both great and troubled about humanity and and uh and that was sort of that was in some ways

the problem that that needed to be solved so you think that the motivation of

imitation is the the essential first steps that led us to become

human um there's some story like and again this is a one-dimensional one

explanation fits all but yeah the EXP sort of the explanation I would I would

go with is that it was it was something like um you know our brains got bigger

and so we were more powerful imitation machines and there were things about

that that were you know that were um yeah that made us a lot more powerful

and a lot we could learn things and we could remember things and there was cultural transmission that happened but

then um it also we could build better weapons and we became more violent

and um it it also had a very very destructive element and then somehow the

imitation you know had to be had to be channeled in in these sort of ritualized

religious you know kinds of ways and that's that's that's why um I I think

all these things sort of somehow came to up together in parallel what about the physical adaptation like what would be

the motivation of the animal to change form and to have its brain grow so large

and to lose all its hair and to become soft and fleshy like we are as opposed

to like rough and durable like almost every other primate

is well you can always man you can always tell these retrospective Just So

Stories and how this all all worked out but it it would seem the the naive

retrospective story would be that uh um you know there are a lot of ways that humans are

I don't know less strong than the other apes or you know there all all these

ways where we're in some sense weaker physically at least physically but um but maybe it was just this basic

trade-off you you know yeah more more of your energy went into your mind and into

your brain and um and then you know um

you you were your fist wasn't as strong but you could build a better

Axe and that made you stronger than an ape and that's that's yeah where where

you know a brain with you know less I don't know less energy was spent on growing a hair to keep warm in the

winter and and then you used your brain to build an Axe and skin a bear and get

get some fur for the winter some something like that yeah I guess it's just but it's just such a leap it's such

a leap and different than any other animal like and like what was the primary motivating factor like what the

thing you know McKenna believes it was psilocybin you know I'm sure you probably ever heard that theory McKenna's Stone ape Theory which is a

fasina any one but there's a lot of different theories about what took place

but we're just well the one yeah the one

I would go on was that there was this dimension of increased imitation there

was some kind of cultural linguistic Dimension that was incredibly um

important um it probably was also

you know it was probably also uh somehow

linked to uh to uh you know dealing with

um all the violence that came with it all the conflicts that that that came

with it um you know I would be I'd be more open to the stoned ape theory if

people um I had this conversation with the other guy Mur rescu the immortality

key Guy and um I always feel they whitewash it too much how so you know

it's like if I mean if if you had these crazy Dian rituals in which people you

know if you know there's probably lots of crazy sex there was probably lots of crazy violence that was was tied to it

and and so maybe like maybe you'd be out of your mind to be hunting a woolly mammoth and like maybe maybe you can't

be completely you know but they weren't hunting Willie Mammoth during the ucini Mysteries no but you were I don't know

you went to went to war to fight the neighboring tribe it's probably more dangerous than hunting right but they also did absolutely have these rituals

and they have absolutely found Trace elements of I don't I don't question that okay I don't question that at all I

I I just I I I just I just think uh they

they probably part of it was ALS also uh was a way to channel violence was

probably you know whenever I don't know was there some some degree to which um

whenever you went to war you were on drugs you were well we know about the Vikings the Vikings most certainly took

mushrooms before they went into battle and

um and you know maybe it makes you less less coordinated or something but

but if you're just if you're less scared that's probably it doesn't make you less coordinated if you're just a little bit less scared that's probably super important it increases visual Acuity

there's a lot of benefits that would happen physically especially if you got

the dose right you know um it increases visual Acuity edge detections better uh

makes people more sensitive probably more aware probably a better Hunter and uh but I think I I I'm I'm I'm

sympathetic to all all these um mushrooms um psychedelic drug

historical usage theories I suspect was very widespread um I just think you know

a lot of it was in in these contexts that uh that were pretty trans aggressive yeah I think um they're not

mutually exclusive I think just giving the the way the world was back then for sure violence was everywhere violence

was a part of daily life violence was a part of how Society was kept together

violence was entertainment in Rome right for sure violence was uh was everything

was a big part of it and I think release and and the anxiety of that violence also LED people to want to be

intoxicated and do different things that uh separated them from a normal State of Consciousness um but I do think it's

also probably where democracy came from I I think having those ilian mystery rituals where they would get together

and do psychedelics and under this very controlled set and setting I think that's the birthplace of a lot of very

interesting and innovative ideas I think a lot of interesting and innovative

ideas currently are are being at least

uh dreamt up thought of they have their roots in some sort of altered conscious

experience well

um it's man I I don't know I I think this stuff is very powerful I think it is it

is I definitely think it shouldn't be

outlawed you know pretty hardcore libertarian on all the drug legalization

stuff uh and then

I I do I do Wonder

um I do Wonder exactly how how how how how these things

work

it probably you know probably the

classical World version of it um was

that it was something that you did in a fairly controlled

setting you didn't do it every day um and it was it was sort of it was some it

was some way uh I imagine to get you know a very different perspective on

your 9 to-5 job or whatever you want to call it but uh you didn't necessarily

want to you know want to really DeCamp to the other world altogether oh for

sure it's too dangerous to do um I don't think anybody thinks they did did I think that was part of the whole thing

where do where do you think where do you think that line is like you know should

PE should everyone do one iasa trip or if you do if you do an iasa trip a year

is that I don't think everyone has to do anything and I think everyone has their

own requirements and I think um I think as you do that everything like this especially psychedelics one of the more

disappointing things recently was that the FDA had denied um they they did these MDMA trials for you know about all

this yep yeah very very disappointing um that they wanted to make MDMA therapy

available to Veterans and people with severe PTSD and it has extreme benefits clinical benefits known documented

benefits and for whatever reason the FDA decided that they have to go through a whole new series of Trials to tr try to

get this stuff legalized which is very disappointing and yeah I I I

I was I was very bullish on the stuff

happening um and the way I thought about it four or five years ago was um that um

it was a hack to doing a double blind study and because the FDA always has

this concept that you need to do a double blind study you give one one you know onethird of the people you give a

sugar pill and two-thirds you give the real drug and you have to and no one knows whether they have the sugar pill or the real drug and then um and then

you see how it works works and science requires a double blind study and then

my my anti- double blind study theory is if if it really works you don't need a

double blind study it should just work and there's something sociopathic about doing double blind studies because one

third of the people who have this bad disease are getting a sugar pill and we we shouldn't even be like maybe it's um

immoral to do double blind studies studies on unique and novel things make sense

um this is not unique nor novel it's been around a long well unique yes but

well my my claim is if it's if it's a um uh if it actually works you shouldn't

need to do a double blind study at all but um and then my Hope was that um MDMA

psychedelics all these things they were a hack on the double blind study because um you knew whether you got the real

thing or the sugar pill and so this would be a way to um to hack through this ridiculous double blind Criterion

and just get the study done and then what I what I think um part part of it

it's probably just an anti-drug ideology by the FDA but um but the other part that happened on the sort of science

scientific establishment level is they think you need a double blind study Joe we know you're hacking this double blind

study because people will know whether they got the sugar pill or not and that's why we're going to arbitrarily

change the goal posts and set them at way way harder because we know there's no way you can do a double blind study and if it's not a double blind study

it's no good because that's what our ideology of science tells us and um and

that's sort of that's sort of what I think was part of part of what went um sort of politically Haywire with this

stuff well I also think that it's Pandora's Box I think that's a real

issue and that if uh they do find extreme benefit in using MDMA therapy particularly for veterans if they start

doing and it starts becoming very effective and it becomes well known and widespread then it will open up the door to all these other psychedelic compounds

and I think that's a real threat to the powers that be it's a real threat to the establishment if you have people

thinking in a completely alternative way and mean we saw what happened during the 1960s and that's one of the reasons why

they threw water on everything and had it become schedule one and locked the country down in terms of the the access

to psychedelics all that stuff happened out of a reaction to the way society and

culture was changing in the 1960s if that happened today it would throw a

giant monkey wrench in our political system in our cultural system the way we govern the way we just the way

allocation of resources all that would change if I if I if I just to articulate

the alternate version on this um there's

always a you know there's there's a part um let me think

how to how to get this

um you know there's there's one there's a question whether um this

the shift to interiority um is it a compliment or a substitute like what I said about talk

and action is it a compliment or a substitute to changing the outside world so we focus on changing ourselves is

this the first step to changing the world or is it um is it sort of a hypnotic way

in which our attention is being redirected to from outer space to Inner Space so I don't know the one liner I

had years ago was um you know we landed on the moon in July of 1969 and three weeks later Woodstock

started and that's when the hippies took over the country and um and you know and um we stopped going to outer space because we started going to Inner Space

and that's and so there's sort of a question um you know how much the you know

um it it it worked as a um as an

activator or as a or as a a deactivator in a way um and uh you know there are

all these different modalities of interiority there's psychological therapy there's meditation there's yoga

there's um you know there was a sexual Revolution there were gradually you have incels living in their parents basement

playing video games so they all you know there's um the naval gazing that is

identity politics um there's a range of psychedelic things and um and I think

all of these things um I I I wonder whether the interiority ended up acting as a as a

substitute because you know the alternate history in the 1960s is that um you know the hippies were actually

they were anti-political and uh it was it was sort of that the the the drugs happened at

the end of the city at the end of the 60s and that's when people depoliticized you it was like I don't know the beatle s you're carrying around pictures of

shairon ma you're not going to make with anyone anyhow it's like that's after they did LSD it was just the sort of

insane politics no longer matters and so you have the Civil Rights the Vietnam War and then were the drugs the thing

that motivated it or was that was that the thing where it actually um those those things started to started to

deescalate I think they were happening at the same time and I think the Vietnam war coinciding with the psychedelic drug

movement in the 1960s it was one of the reasons why it was so dangerous to The Establishment CU these people were far

less likely to buy into this idea that they needed to fly to Vietnam and go kill people they didn't know and they

were far less likely to support any war and I think there was this sort of

bizarre movement that we had never seen before this flower children move that we know that they plotted against I mean if

you read chaos uh by Tom O'Neal familiar with fantastic book that shows you what

they were trying to do to demonize these these hippies well was or or or the the part of it that I thought was

interesting was the MK Ultra yeah which part of it where um you know we uh there

was a a predecessor version where uh we thought of um you know there was a you

could think of it as we had an arms race with f the fascists and the Communists and they were very good at brainwashing

people the gobl propaganda North Koreans brainwashing our soldiers

in the Korean War um our PS and uh we needed to have an arms race

to program and reprogram and deprogram

people and um LSD was uh was was sort of

the MK ultra shortcut so I think I think

there was and then I yeah my so hard to reconstruct it but uh my

my suspicion is that the MK Ultra thing was was a lot bigger than than we realize and that uh you

know it was it was the LSD movement both in the Harvard form and the Stanford form you know it started it started as

an MK Ultra project Timothy liry at Harvard um Ken keesy at Stanford you

know I knew uh Tom Wolf the um American novelist I still think his

greatest novel was uh um the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test which is sort of this history of the LSD counterculture

movement starts at Stanford moves the hate Ashbury and San Francisco and uh but it starts with Ken key a grad

student at Stanford like I Circa

1958 and um you get an extra $75 a day if you go to the Meno Park veterans

hospital and um they give you some

random drug and um yeah he got extra $75

a grad student in English um doing LSD and um Tom Wolf writes this you know

iconic uh fictionalized novel very realistic

1968 about this and um wolf could not have imagined that the whole thing

started as some CIA mind control project right the menal park veterans hospital

that was deep State adjacent sure well ha ashbery free clinic run by the CIA sure that's even crazier the whole

thing's crazy Jolly Jolly West guy y yeah the the whole thing's crazy which

leads me to what do you think they're doing today

if they were doing that then I do not believe that they abandoned this idea of programming people I do not believe that

I don't think they would because I know it's effective look people join Cults every day we're well aware that people

can be ideologically captured we're well aware we're well aware people will buy into crazy ideas as long as it's

supported by whatever Community they associate with that's a just a natural aspect of being a human being maybe it's

part of what you were saying this imitation thing that we have it leads us to do this if they have that knowledge and that understanding that for sure

they're probably doing things similar today which is one of the things that I think about a lot when I think about

this guy that tried to shoot Trump I I want to know what happened and

I don't think we're getting a very detailed explanation at all as to how this person

achieved these the get how he they got on the roof how they got to that position how they trained what who were

they in contact with who was teaching them why did they why did they do it

what was going on we we are in the dark and I wonder like you know that was always The Manchurian Candidate idea

right this idea that we trained assassins and was the RFK uh dad um

assassination 196 s where um he again maybe shouldn't believe him but he claimed that uh he didn't even know what

he was doing it was on some hypnotic trance or whatever and it was like it was like the assassin

in The Manchurian Candidate yeah yeah I mean that is possible I don't know if he's telling the truth he could have

just had a psychotic break who knows obviously also convenient yeah very convenient but it's a possibility that

she could be should be considered I mean I this Crooks kid that did this that

shot at the president what how what

happened I want to know what happened man I I don't I

I probably Veer in the direction that there

were you know on the on the sort of conspiracy theory of History I Veer in

the direction that there was a lot of crazy stuff like this that was going on

in the US first half of the 20th century overdrive 1940s you I mean you had the

Manhattan Project there's this giant

secret project uh 1950 s

1960s and then um and then somehow the

last 50 years I think the I'm not sure disturbing uh P but the perspective I

have is these institutions are less functional I I don't think um I don't

think the CIA is doing anything quite like MK Ultra anymore um why do you think that
