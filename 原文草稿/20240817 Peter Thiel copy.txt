And then every three to four years after that.

Peter Thiel

So when it becomes unthinkable to kill the pharaoh, the pharaoh gets turned into a living God. Before that, the pharaoh gets murdered and then gets worshipped as a dead pharaoh or distant God.

Joe Rogan

That's interesting, but it still doesn't solve the engineering puzzle. The engineering puzzle is the biggest one. How did they do that?

Peter Thiel

Well, the one I'm focusing on is the motivational puzzle. Why?

Joe Rogan

Even if you have all the motivation in the world, if you want to build a structure that's insane to build today, and you're doing it 4500 years ago, we're dealing with a massive puzzle.

Peter Thiel

I think the motivational part is the harder one to solve. If you can figure out the motivation, you'll figure out a way to organize the whole society. And if you get the whole society working on it, you can probably do it.

Joe Rogan

But don't you think that his grasp of power was in peril in the first place? Which is why they decided to come up with this idea of turning them into a living goddess. So to have the amount of resources and power and then the engineering and then the understanding of whatever methods they use to shape and move these things.

Peter Thiel

Well, this is always the anthropological debate between Voltaire, the enlightenment thinker of the 18th century, and DURkHeim, the 19th century anthropologist. AnD VOltaire believes that religion originates as a conspiracy of the priests to maintain power. And so politics comes. First, the politicians invent religion, and then Durkheim says the causation is the other way around, that somehow religion came first and then politics somehow came out of it. Of course, once the politics comes out of it, the priests the religious authorities have political power. They figure out ways to manipulate it, things like this.

But I find the Durkheim story far more plausible than the Voltaire one. I think the religious categories are primary and the political categories are secondary.

Joe Rogan

So you think the religion came first? But what about if we emanated from tribal societies? Tribal societies have always had leaders. When you have leaders, you're going to have dissent, you're going to have challenges, you're going to have politicking, you have people negotiating to try to maintain power, keep power, keep everything organized. That's the origin of politics, correct?

Peter Thiel

I think that's a whitewashed, enlightenment, rationalist description of the origin of politics.

Joe Rogan

What do you think, the origin of politics?

Peter Thiel

I think it's far more violent than that.

What you're giving me, well, it's very vile.

Joe Rogan

The control and power and maintaining power involves murderous sabotage.

Peter Thiel

Well, okay, that's more like it. But what you gave me a minute ago sounds more like a social contract theory in which people sit down, negotiate, and have a nice legal chit chat to draw up the social contract. That is a complete fiction.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I don't think that. I think that there was probably various levels of civility that were achieved when agriculture and when establishments were constructed that were near resources, where they didn't have to worry as much about food and water and things along those lines, things probably got a little bit more civil. But I think that the origins of it are like the origins of all human conflict. It's filled with murder.

Peter Thiel

Well, I think at the beginning was madness and murder.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, madness and murder.

Peter Thiel

And. I don't know.

I don't know if it got. I don't know if it got that much more rational. I don't know if it's that much more rational today.

Joe Rogan

Well, so in some ways, it's not right.

Peter Thiel

This is, again, back to the, you know, the progressive conception. Are we. You know, are we really. Have we really progressed?

How much have we really progressed from that? But, yeah, my version would be that it was, you know, it was much more.

It was organized around, you know, acts of mass violence. Like maybe you externalized it onto a mastodon or hunting some big animal or something like this.

But the real problem of violence, you know, it wasn't external. It was mostly internal.

It was violence with people who were near you, proximate to you.

It wasn't even natural cataclysms or other tribes.

It was sort of much more the internal stuff, and it's very different. I think the human situation is somehow very, very different from something like, I don't know, an ape primate hierarchy, where in an ape context, you have an alpha male, he's the strongest, and there's some sort of natural dominance, and you don't need to have a fight to the death, typically, because you know who's the strongest, and you don't need to push it all the way. In a human context, it's always possible for two or three guys to gang up on the alpha male. So it's somehow the culture is more important if they can talk to each other and you get language, and then they can coordinate and they can gang up on the leader, and then you have to stop them from gang up on the leader. And how do you do that? And so there's some sort of radical difference between a human and, let's say, a pre human world.

Joe Rogan

Have you seen chimp empire?

Peter Thiel

No.

Joe Rogan

Chimp Empire is a fascinating documentary series on Netflix, where these scientists had been embedded with this tribe of chimpanzees for decades. And so because they were embedded, they had very specific rules. You have to maintain at least 20 yards from you. And any of the chimpsd. No food. You can never have food, and don't look them in the eyes. And as long as you do that, they don't feel you're a threat. And they think of you as a natural part of their environment, almost like you don't exist. And they behave completely naturally. Well, it shows in that that sometimes it's not the largest, strongest one, and that some chimps form bonds with other chimps, and they form coalitions, and they do have some sort of politicking, and they do help each other. They groom each other, they do specific things for each other. And then one of the things that happens also, they get invaded by other chimps, and that chimps leave and they go on patrol, and other chimps gang up on them and kill them. And they try to fight and battle over resources. So it's not nearly as cut and dry as the strongest chimp prevails. Because one of the chimps that was dominant was an older chimp, and he was smaller than some of the other chimps, but he had formed a coalition with all these other chimps, and they all respected him, and they all knew that they would be treated fairly. And being treated fairly is a very important thing with chimpanzees. They get very jealous if they think that things are not fair, which is why that guy was attacked.

You know that guy who had a pet chimpanzee, he brought it a birthday cake. The other chimps weren't getting a piece of the cake, and someone had fucked up and left a door open. They got out and mauled this guy because he didn't give them some of the cake.

Peter Thiel

I find all of that quite plausible, but I think both of us can be correct. So there's some.

The true story of hominization of how we became humans, there's a way to tell it where it's continuous with our animal past and where it's just, you know, there's things like this with the chimpanzees or the baboons or, you know, other primates. And then there is a part of the story that I think is also more discontinuous.

And my judgment is we probably, in a darwinian context, we always stress the continuity.

I'm always a little bit the contrarian. And so I believe in Darwin's theory, but I think we should also be skeptical of ways it's too dogmatic. And Darwin's theories make us gloss over the discontinuities.

The one type of incident, it happened overnight. But one type of fairly dramatic discontinuity is that humans have something like language. And even though chimpanzees probably, I don't know, they have an iq of 80 or they're pretty smart, but when you don't have a rich symbolic system that leads to a very, very different kind of structure, and there's something about language and the kind of coordination that allows and the ways that it forces you to. Enables you to coordinate on violence, and then it encourages you to channel violence in certain sacred religious directions, I think creates something radically different about human society.

Humans tell each other stories.

A lot of the stories are not true. They're myths. But I think that's some sort of a very important difference from even our closest primate relatives.

But this is, again, this is sort of like another way of getting at what's so crazy about chat, GPT and passing the Turing test. Because if we had sat here two years ago and you asked me, what is the distinctive feature of a human being? What makes someone a human? And in a way that differs from everybody else, it's not perfect, but my go to answer would been, language.

You're a three year old, you're an 80 year old.

Just about all humans can speak languages. Just about all non humans cannot speak languages.

It's this binary thing. And then that's sort of a way of telling us again, why passing the Turing test was way more important than super intelligence or anything else.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I could see that.

Peter Thiel

I don't want to go back to that tangent.

Joe Rogan

No, it's a good tangent.

Peter Thiel

Go ahead, connect.

Joe Rogan

Great. Keep tangenting off. Have fun. It's great.

Do you think. What do you think the factor was? There's a lot of debate about this. Like, the factor was that separated us from these animals and why we became what we became, because we're so vastly different than any other primate.

So what do you think took place? Like, the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years is one of the greatest mysteries in the entire fossil record. We don't know what the fuck happened. There's a lot of theories. The throwing arm, cooking meat. There's a lot of theories, but we really have no idea.

Peter Thiel

Well, again, let me do sort of a linguistic riff. I think Aristoteliandeh, darwinian biology. Aristotle. You always differ things by put them in categories. And I think the line Aristotle has is something man differs from the other animals in his greater aptitude for imitation.

And I would say that we are these giant imitating machines. And, of course, the darwinian riff on this is, you know, to imitate is to ape.

And so we differ from the ape. We're more ape like than the apes. We are far better at aping each other than the apes are. And that to, you know, a first cut, I would say our brains are giant imitation machines. That's how you learn language as a kid. You imitate your parents, and that's how culture gets transmitted. But then there are a lot of dimensions of imitation that are also very dangerous, because it's not. Imitation doesn't just happen on this symbolic, linguistic level. It's also you imitate things you want.

You want a banana? I want a banana. You want a blue ball? I can have a red ball. I want a blue ball. Because you have a blue ball.

And so there's something about imitation that creates culture, you know, that is incredibly important pedagogically learning.

It's how you master something in all these different ways.

And then a lot of it has this incredibly conflictual dimension as well.

And then there's. Yes, I think that was sort of core to the things that are both great and troubled about humanity.

And that was sort of. That was, in some ways, the problem that needed to be solved.

Joe Rogan

So you think that the motivation of imitation is the essential first steps that led us to become human.

Peter Thiel

There's some story like. And again, this is a one dimensional, one explanation fits all.

The explanation I would go with is that it was something like our brains got bigger, and so we were more powerful imitation machines. And there were things about that made us a lot more powerful and a lot. We could learn things and we could remember things, and there was cultural transmission that happened, but then it also, we could build better weapons and we became more violent, and it also had a very, very destructive element. And then somehow the imitation had to be channeled in these sort of ritualized, religious kinds of ways. And that's why I think all these things sort of somehow came up together in parallel.

Joe Rogan

What about the physical adaptation? Like, what would be the motivation of the animal to change form and to have its brain grow so large and to lose all its hair and to become soft and fleshy like we are, as opposed to, like, rough and durable like almost every other primate is?

Peter Thiel

Well, you can always, man, you can always tell these retrospective just so stories and how this all, all worked out. But it. It would seem the naive retrospective story would be that, you know, there are a lot of ways that humans are, I don't know, less strong than the other apes or, you know, all these ways where we're in some sense weaker physically, physically, but. But maybe it was just this basic trade off, you know? Yeah. More. More of your energy went into your mind and into your brain, and then your fist wasn't as strong, but you could build a better ax, and that made you stronger than an ape.

And that's where a brain with less energy was spent on growing a hair to keep warm in the winter.

And then you used your brain to build an axe and skin a bear and get some fur for the winter or something like that.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I guess it's just. But it's just such a leap.

It's such a leap and different than any other animal.

What was the primary motivating factor? What was the thing? McKenna believes it was psilocybin.

I'm sure you probably heard that theory. McKenna's stone date theory, which is a fascinating one, but there's a lot of different theories about what took place. But we'll just.

Peter Thiel

Well, the one. Yeah, the one I would go on was that there was this dimension of increased imitation.

There was some kind of cultural, linguistic dimension that was incredibly important.

It probably was also, you know, it was probably also somehow linked to dealing with all the violence that came with it, all the conflicts that came with it.

I'd be more open to the stoned ape theory.

I had this conversation with the other guy, Murorescu, the immortality key guy, and I always feel they whitewash a too much.

Joe Rogan

How so?

Peter Thiel

You know, it's like if. I mean, if, if you had these crazy dionysian rituals in which people, you know, if, you know, there's probably lots of crazy sex, there's probably lots of crazy violence that was, was tied to it. And so maybe like, maybe you'd be out of your mind to be hunting a woolly mammoth, and like, maybe you can't be completely, you know.

Joe Rogan

But they weren't hunting woolly mammoths during the eleusinian mysteries.

Peter Thiel

No, but you, I don't know, you went to war to fight the neighboring tribes. It's probably more dangerous than hunting.

Joe Rogan

Right. But they also did absolutely have these rituals and they have absolutely found trace elements of.

Peter Thiel

I don't question that.

Joe Rogan

Okay.

Peter Thiel

I don't question that at all.

I just think probably part of it was also was a way to channel violence. It was probably, you know, whenever, I don't know, was there some degree to which whenever you went to war, you were on drugs, you were.

Joe Rogan

Well, we know Vikings. The Vikings most certainly took mushrooms before they went into battle.

Peter Thiel

And maybe it makes you less coordinated or something, but just if you're less.

Joe Rogan

Scared, it's probably, it doesn't make you less coordinated.

Peter Thiel

If you're just a little bit less scared, that's probably super important.

Joe Rogan

It increases visual acuity. There's a lot of benefits that would happen physically, especially if you got the dose right.

It increases visual acuity. Edge detection's better. It makes people more sensitive, probably more aware, probably a better hunter.

Peter Thiel

But I'm sympathetic to all these mushrooms.

Psychedelic drug historical usage theories I suspect was very widespread.

I just think a lot of it was in these contexts that were pretty transgressive.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I think they're not mutually exclusive. I think just giving the way the world was back then, for sure. Violence was everywhere. Violence was a part of daily life. Violence was a part of how society was kept together. Violence was entertainment in Rome. Right? For sure. Violence was everything. It was a big part of it. And I think release and the anxiety of that violence also led people to want to be intoxicated and do different things that separated them from a normal state of consciousness.

But I do think it's also probably where democracy came from. I think having those illusion mystery rituals where they would get together and do psychedelics under this very controlled set and setting, I think thats the birthplace of a lot of very interesting and innovative ideas. I think a lot of interesting and innovative ideas currently are being at least dreamt up thought of. They have their roots in some sort of altered conscious experience?

Peter Thiel

Well, it's.

I don't know. I think this stuff is very powerful. I think it is.

It is.

I definitely think it shouldn't be outlawed.

You know, pretty hardcore libertarian on all the drug legalization stuff.

And then I do wonder.

I do wonder exactly how these things work.

Probably the classical world version of it was that it was something that you did in a fairly controlled setting.

You didn't do it every day.

And it was. It was sort of.

It was some. It was some way, I imagine, to get, you know, a very different perspective on your nine to five job, or whatever you want to call it, but you didn't necessarily want to, you know, want to really decamp the other world altogether.

Joe Rogan

Oh, for sure. It's too dangerous to do.

I don't think anybody thinks they did. I think that was part of the whole thing.

Peter Thiel

Where do you think. Where do you think that line is like, you know, should people. Should everyone do one ayahuasca trip? Or if you do. If you do an ayahuasca trip a year, is that too much?

Joe Rogan

Everyone has to do anything, and I think everyone has their own requirements, and I think as you do, that everything like this, especially psychedelics. One of the more disappointing things recently was that the FDA had denied they did these MDMA trials for, you know, about all this.

Peter Thiel

Yep.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. Very, very disappointing that they wanted to make MDMA therapy available to veterans and people with severe PTSD. And it has extreme benefits, clinical benefits, known documented benefits. And for whatever reason, the FDA decided that they have to go through a whole new series of trials to try to get this stuff legalized, which is very disappointing.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, I was very bullish on this stuff happening.

And the way I thought about it four or five years ago was that it was a hackath to doing a double blind study, because the FDA always has this concept that you need to do a double blind study. You give one third of the people, you give a sugar pill, and two thirds you give the real drug, and no one knows whether they have the sugar pill or the real drug.

And then you see how it works. And science requires a double blind study. And then my anti double blind study theory is, if it really works, you don't need a double blind study. It should just work. And there's something sociopathic about doing double blind studies because one third of the people who have this bad disease are getting a sugar pill, and we shouldn't even be like, maybe it's immoral to do double blind studies.

Joe Rogan

Well, double blind studies on unique and novel things makes sense but this is not unique nor novel. It's been around long.

Peter Thiel

Well, unique, yes, but my claim is if it actually works, you shouldn't need to do double blind study at all.

And then my hope was that MDMA, psychedelics, all these things, they were a hack on the double blind study because you knew whether you got the real thing or the sugar pill. And so this would be a way to hack through this ridiculous double blind criterion and just get the study done. And then what? I think part of it probably just an anti drug ideology by the FDA.

But the other part that happened on the sort of science, scientific establishment level is they think you need a double blind study. Joe, we know you're hacking this double blind study because people will know whether they got the sugar pill or not. And that's why we're going to arbitrarily change the goal posts and set them at way, way harder, because we know there's no way you can do a double blind study. And if it's not a double blind study, it's no good, because that's what our ideology of science tells us. And that's sort of what I think was part of what went sort of politically haywire with this stuff.

Joe Rogan

Well, I also think that it's Pandora's box.

I think that's a real issue. And that if they do find extreme benefit in using MDMA therapy, particularly for veterans, if they start doing that and it starts becoming very effective and it becomes well known and widespread, then it will open up the door to all these other psychedelic compounds. And I think that's a real threat to the powers that be. It's a real threat to the establishment. If you have people thinking in a completely alternative way. I mean, we saw what happened during the 1960s, and that's one of the reasons why they threw water on everything and had it become schedule one and lock the country down. In terms of the access to psychedelics, all that stuff happened out of a reaction to the way society and culture was changing in the 1960s. If that happened today, it would throw a giant monkey wrench in our political system, in our cultural system, the way we govern, the way we just, the way allocation of resources, all of that would change.

Peter Thiel

Just to articulate the alternate version on this, there's always a, you know, there's a part.

Let me think how to. How to get this.

You know, there's one, there's a question whether the shift to interiority, is it a complement or a substitute? Like what I said about talk and action. Is it a complement or a substitute to changing the outside world. So we focus on changing ourselves. Is this the first step to changing the world? Or is it sort of a hypnotic way in which our attention is being redirected from outer space to inner space? So I don't know the one liner I had years ago, Washington. We landed on the moon in July of 1969, and three weeks later Woodstock started. And that's when the hippies took over the country and we stopped going to outer space because we started going to inner space.

And so there's sort of a question how much it worked as an activator or as a.

Or as a deactivator in a way.

And there are all these different modalities of interiority. There's psychological therapy, there's meditation, there's yoga.

There was a sexual revolution.

Gradually you have incels living in their parents basement playing video games. So there's the navel gazing. That is identity politics.

There's a range of psychedelic things, and I think all of these things, I wonder whether the interiority ended up acting as a substitute, because the alternate history in the 1960s is that the hippies were actually, they were anti political. And it was sort of that the drugs happened at the end of the city at the end of the sixties, and that's when people depoliticized. It was like, I don't know, the Beatles song. You're carrying around pictures of Chairman Mao you're not going to make with anyone anyhow. It's like that's after they did LSD. It was just the sort of insane politics no longer matters. And so you have the civil rights, the Vietnam War. And then were the drugs the thing that motivated it, or was that the thing where it actually those things started to deescalate?

Joe Rogan

I think they were happening at the same time. And I think the Vietnam war coinciding with the psychedelic drug movement in the 1960s, it was one of the reasons why it was so dangerous to the establishment, because these people were far less likely to buy into this idea that they needed to fly to Vietnam and go kill people they didn't know, and they were far less likely to support any war. And I think there was this sort of bizarre movement that we had never seen before, this flower children that we know that they plotted against. I mean, if you read chaos by Tom O'Neill, fantastic book that shows you what they were trying to do to demonize these hippies.

Peter Thiel

Well, it was. Or the part of it that I thought was interesting was the MkUltra.

Joe Rogan

Yeah.

Peter Thiel

Which is a part of it where there was a predecessor version where we thought of, you know, there was a. You could think of it as we had an arms race with the fascists and the communists. And they were very good at brainwashing people, the Goebbels, propaganda, North Koreans brainwashing our soldiers in the Korean War, our pows.

And we needed to have an arms race to program and reprogram and deprogram people. And LSD, Washington was sort of the Mkultra shortcut. So I think there was.

And then I. Yeah, my.

So hard to reconstruct it. But my suspicion is that the MkUltra thing was. Was a lot bigger than. Than we realize. And that, you know, it was the LSD movement, both in the Harvard form and the Stanford form. You know, it started. It started as an Mkultra project. Timothy Leary at Harvard, Ken Kesey at Stanford. I knew Tom Wolf, the american novelist. I still think his greatest novel was the electric Kool Aid acid test, which is sort of this history of the LSD counterculture movement. Starts at Stanford, moves to Haight Ashbury in San Francisco.

But it starts with Ken Kesey as a grad student at Stanford circa 1958. And you get an extra $75 a day if you go to the Menlo Park Veterans hospital and they give you some random drug.

And.

Yeah, he got extra $75 as a grad student in English doing LSD. And Tom Wolfe writes this iconic fictionalized novel, very realistic, 1968, about this.

Wolf could not have imagined that the whole thing started as some CIA mind control project.

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

The Menlo Park Veterans Hospital. That was deep state adjacent.

Joe Rogan

Sure. Well, haight Ashbury free clinic run by the CIA. Sure.

Peter Thiel

That's even crazier.

Joe Rogan

The whole thing's crazy.

Peter Thiel

The jolly west guy. Yep.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, the whole thing's crazy. Which leads me to, what do you think they're doing today?

If they were doing that, then I do not believe that they abandoned this idea of programming people. I do not believe that. I don't think they would, because I know it's effective. Look, people join cults every day. We're well aware that people can be ideologically captured. We're well aware. We're well aware people will buy into crazy ideas as long as it's supported by whatever community they associate with. That's just a natural aspect of being a human being. Maybe it's part of what you were saying. This imitation thing that we have, it leads us to do this. If they have that knowledge and that understanding, for sure, they're probably doing things similar today, which is one of the things that I think about a lot when I think about this guy that tried to shoot Trump.

I want to know what happened.

And I don't think we're getting a very detailed explanation at all as to how this person achieved these.

How they got on the roof, how they got to that position, how they trained, what. Who were they in contact with? Who was teaching them? Why did they. Why did they do it? What was going on? We are in the dark. And I wonder, like, you know, there was always the manchurian candidate idea, right? This idea that we trained assassins.

Peter Thiel

And was the RFK dad assassination, 1961, six, where he, again, maybe shouldn't believe him, but he claimed that he didn't even know what he was doing. It was some hypnotic trance or whatever, and it was like the assassin in the manchurian canyon.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is possible.

I don't know if he's telling the truth. He could have just had a psychotic break.

Peter Thiel

Who knows? Obviously, also convenient.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, very convenient. But it's a possibility that she should be considered. I mean, this crooks kid that did this, that shot at the president, what?

How. What happened? I want to know what happened, man.

Peter Thiel

I don't.

I probably veer in the direction that there were, you know, on the sort of conspiracy theory of history.

I veer in the direction that there was a lot of crazy stuff like this that was going on in the US, first half of the 20th century, overdrive, 1940s.

I mean, you had the Manhattan project. There's this giant secret project, 1950s, 1960s, and then somehow the last 50 years, I think the.

I'm not sure. Disturbing.

But the perspective I have is these institutions are less functional.

I don't think the CIA is doing anything quite like MkUltra anymore.

Joe Rogan

Why do you think that?

Peter Thiel

I think you had the church commission hearings in the late seventies, and somehow things got exposed.

And then when bureaucracy is forced to be formalized, it probably becomes a lot less functional, like the two thousands version.

I think there was a lot of crazy stuff that we did in black sites, torturing people that the CIA ran in the war on terror, waterboarding. There's all sorts of batshit crazy stuff that happened. But then once John Yoo in the Bush 43 administration writes the torture memos and sort of formalizes, this is how many times you can water dunk someone without it being torture, et cetera, et cetera. Once you formalize it, people somehow know that it's on its way out because, you know, it doesn't quite work anymore. So by. I don't know, by 2007 at Guantanamo, I think the inmates were running the asylum. The inmates and the defense lawyers were running it. You were way safer as a muslim terrorist in Guantanamo than as a, let's say, a suspected cop killer in Manhattan. There was still an informal process in Manhattan. You were a suspected cop killer. Theyd figure out some way to deal with you outside the formal judicial process.

But I think something, there was sort of formalization that happened. There was the post J. Edgar Hoover, FBI, where Hoover was, I dont know, a law unto himself.

It was completely out of control.

CIA even more so.

And then, you know, once it all gets exposed, and it probably is a lot harder to do, the NSA, you know, NSA probably held up longer as a deep state entity where it at least had the virtue people, you know, I think the 1980s, it was still referred to as no such agency. So it was still far more obscure. So the necessary condition is that if some part of the deep state is doing it, you know, we, we can barely know what's going on with them. And then, I don't know, the two thousands 2010s history, I think the Patriot act empowered all these FISA courts. And I think there was, I think there probably were ways the NSA FISA court process was weaponized in a really, really crazy way.

And it culminated in 2016 with all the crazy Russia conspiracy theories against Trump.

But I think even that, I'm not sure they can do anymore because it got exposed, can't do that anymore.

Joe Rogan

But a small program that is top secret, that is designed under the auspices of protecting american lives, extracting information from.

Peter Thiel

People, I'm agreeing with you.

The NSA FISA court process is one where you had a pretty out of control process from, let's say, circa, I don't know, 2003 to 2017, 2018. So that's relatively recent history.

I don't know. You know, they're all the, all the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories, which I'm probably too fascinated by because it felt like there was, there was some crazy stuff going on that they were able to cover up but still are.

And then I, but then, man, doesn't the fact that we're still talking about Jeffrey Epstein tell us how hard it is to come up with anything else?

Joe Rogan

No, because there's no answers for the Jeffrey Epstein thing. There's been no consequences other than Ghislaine Maxwell going to jail and Jeffrey Epstein allegedly committing suicide, which I don't think he did. Other than that, what are the consequences? They were able to pull off this thing, this some, some sort of operation? What, you know, who knows who was behind it? Who knows? What was the motivation? But it clearly has something to do with compromising people, which is an age old strategy for getting people to do what you want them to do. You have things on them. You use those things as leverage, and then next thing you know, you've got people saying things that you want them to say. And it motivates, moves, policy, changes, things, get things done.

That they did that.

Peter Thiel

Yes.

Joe Rogan

And no one. And we know they did that. And yet no one is asking for the tapes. No one's asking for the client list.

We're in the dark still.

Peter Thiel

And probably.

I don't know, man. I spent too much time thinking about all the Epstein variants.

Probably.

Probably the sex stuff is overdone and everything else is underdone. It's like with. It's like a limited hangout. We get to talk about the crazy underage sex and not about all the other questions. It's like when Alex Acosta testified for labor secretary under. He was the DA who prosecuted Epstein in 0809 and got him sort of the very light 13 month or whatever sentence, and it was a South Florida DA or whatever he was.

And Acosta was asked, why did he get off so easily?

And under congressional testimony, when he was up for labor secretary 2017, he belonged to intelligence.

That's. Yeah, and then. And then, you know, and so it's. Yeah, it's.

The question isn't about the sex with the underage women. The question is really about, you know, why was he. Why was he so protected? And then, you know, I went. I went down all these rabbit holes. Was he working for the Israelis or the Mossad or all this sort of stuff? And I've come to think that that was very secondary. Obviously, it was just the US.

If you're working for Israel, you don't get protected. We had Jonathan Pollard. He went to jail for 25 years or whatever, but unrelated.

Right, understood.

But it's.

Joe Rogan

But this is one particular operation.

Peter Thiel

But if it was an intelligence operation, the question we should be asking is, what part of the us intelligence system was he working for? Was he working for, you know, but.

Joe Rogan

Don'T you think that's an effective strategy for controlling politicians, getting them involved in sex scandals? I mean, that's always been one of the worst things that can happen to a politician. Look at Monica Lewinsky. A very simple one. Consensual, inappropriate sexual relationship between a president and a staffer, and it almost takes down the presidency. It causes him to get impeached.

Powerful motivators, the shame of it all. Also the illegal activity, the fact that it's. I mean, it's one of the most disgusting things that we think of with people having sex with underage people.

Peter Thiel

I'm sure that was part of it. I suspect there are a lot of other questions that one should all say.

Joe Rogan

Most certainly, but I would think that that is one of the best motivators that we have is having dirt on people like that, especially something that could ruin your career, especially people that are deeply embedded in this system of people knowing things about people and using those at their advantage. I mean, that's an age old strategy in politics. That was J. Edgar Hoover's entire modus operandi.

Peter Thiel

My riff on it was always that it was, it's a little bit different from the J. Edgar Hoover thing, and the question was always whether the people doing it knew they were getting compromised. And so it's, it's, it's, it's, the vibe is not that you somehow got compromised. It was more, you were joining this, this secret club, right? You got to be made. You're a made man in the mafia.

Joe Rogan

And you got to do crazy things.

Peter Thiel

No, no, no. It's a. Only if we have compromise on you, do you get ahead?

It's like, you know, it's like, I don't know, it's one of these.

Closet of the Vatican. The claim is 80% of the cardinals in the catholic church are gay. Not sure if that's true, but directionally, it's probably correct. And the basic thesis is you don't get promoted to a cardinal if you're straight, because we need to have, and so we need to, you need to be compromised, and then you're under control, but you also get ahead.

Joe Rogan

Completely makes sense. Completely makes sense in the way to do that with, especially all these politicians who are essentially like, bad actors. A lot of them, they're just people that want power and people that want control, a lot of them. And, you know, those kind of guys, they want to party, you know, I mean, that has been, you've got two types of leaders that are presidents. You got pussy hounds and warmongers, you know, and, you know, sometimes you have both, but generally, you don't. You know, guys like Clinton and JFK were anti war, and then you have guys like Bush who you don't think of at all as a pussy hound, but most certainly you think of as a warmonger.

Peter Thiel

Do you?

What do you, do you have a theory on what was Bill Gates complicity with Epstein?

Joe Rogan

I think he likes pussy.

I think he's a man. I think he likes power. He likes monopoly. I mean, he's incredibly effective with Microsoft. And for the longest time, he was thought of as a villain, right? He was this antitrust villain. He was this guy who was monopolizing this operating system and controlling just this incredible empire. And he had a real bad rap. And then I think he wisely turned towards philanthropy.

Peter Thiel

But do you think that he needed Epstein?

Joe Rogan

I think it's very difficult for a very famous, very high profile person to fuck around. I think it's very difficult. I think you have to worry about people telling people you worry about it taking you down. If you're having affairs, if you're running some philanthropy organization, you're supposed to be thought of as this guy who's, like, this wonderful person who's trying to really fix all the problems in the world, but really he's just flying around and banging all these different chicks. You have to figure out a way to pull that off. And this is what Eric Weinstein and I, we've had discussions about this, and Eric's position is that there are people in this world that can provide experiences for you and safely for people that are in that kind of a group. And that makes sense. It makes sense that if you pay people enough and you have people motivated in order to, like, establish these relationships and make sure that these things happen, when you get very high profile, you can't just be on a fucking dating app. And if you're a guy who likes to bang chicks, what are you going to do?

Peter Thiel

All of that might be true, but I wonder if there are more straightforward alternate conspiracy theories on Epstein that we're missing. So let me do an alternate one on Bill Gates, where the things. Just looking at what's hiding in plain sight.

He supposedly talked to Epstein early on about how his marriage wasn't doing that well. And then Epstein suggested that he should get a divorce circa 2010, 2011. And Gates told him something like, you know, that doesn't quite work, presumably because he didn't have a prenup, one part of Epstein as a marriage counselor, which is sort of disturbing.

But then the second thing that we know that Gates talked to Epstein about was sort of all the sort of collaborating on funding, setting up this philanthropy, all this sort of this somewhat corrupt left wing philanthropy structures. And so there's a question, you know, and then my sort of straightforward alternate conspiracy theory is, should we ask?

Should we ask, should we combine those two? And was there, and I don't have all the details on this figured out, but it would be something like Bill and Melinda get married in 1994. They don't sign a prenup, and something's going wrong with the marriage. And maybe Melinda can get half the money in a divorce. He doesn't want her to get half the money. What do you do?

And then the alternate plan is something like, you set up, you commit the marital assets to this nonprofit, and then it sort of locks Melinda into not complaining about the marriage for a long, long time.

And it's some kind of a.

And so there's something about the left wing philanthropy world that was.

It was some sort of boomer way to control their crazy wives or something like this.

Joe Rogan

And that's also an effective way to whitewash your. Your past, your thoughts.

Peter Thiel

And he talked to Epstein about. He got Epstein to meet with the head of the Nobel Prize foundation. So it was. Yeah. Bill Gates wanted to get a Nobel. Nobel Prize.

Joe Rogan

Wow.

Peter Thiel

Right. So this is all. This is all. Yeah. This is all straightforward. This is all known. Yeah.

And I'm not saying what you're saying about.

Joe Rogan

Do you know the history of the Nobel Prize? That's the ultimate whitewashed.

Peter Thiel

Sure. It was fermenting dynamite.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, that's the. He was.

Peter Thiel

He.

Joe Rogan

Well, Peter Berg told me the story. I was blown away. He. Originally, they.

Someone said that he died, and it was printed that he died, but he didn't die. And in the stories, they were calling him the merchant of death because he was the guy that invented dynamite. And he realized that, oh, my God, this is my reputation. This is how people think about me. I have to do something to turn this around. So he invented the Nobel Prize, and he started then. Now the name Nobel is automatically connected in most people's eyes, to the greatest people amongst us, the people that have contributed the most to society and science and art and peace and all these different things. Nobel Prize for medicine, by the way.

Peter Thiel

Super crazy history.

Joe Rogan

It's a crazy history, but it's the ultimate whitewash. It's the same thing. Like, he came up with that prize because he wanted to change his image publicly.

Peter Thiel

And so it's ironic that Bill Gates.

Joe Rogan

Would want to get a Nobel Prize or not.

Peter Thiel

Ironic or. Yes, ironic, but straightforward, understandable, and ironic. But I think.

But then if we.

And so there's. Yeah, so there's a underage sex version of the Epstein story, and then there is a crazy status Nobel Prize history of it. And there is a corrupt left wing philanthropy one. And there is a boomers who didn't sign prenuptial agreements with their wives story.

And I think all those are worth exploring more.

Joe Rogan

I think you're right.

Peter Thiel

That's all I'm saying.

Joe Rogan

What about these left wing philanthropy ventures do you think is uniquely corrupt?

Peter Thiel

Sorry, which one do I think is most corrupt? Or.

Joe Rogan

No, what about them?

When you said corrupt?

Peter Thiel

Yeah.

Well, man, there's something about.

Maybe it's just my hermeneutic of suspicion, but there's something about, you know, there's something about the virtue signaling, and what does it mean? And I always think this is sort of a Europe America versus Europe difference, where in America we're told that, that philanthropy is something a good person does. And if you're a Rockefeller and you start giving away all your money, this is just what a good person does, and it shows how good you are.

And then I think sort of the european intuition on it is something like, wow, that's only something a very evil person does. And if you start giving away all your money in Europe, it's like, Joe, you must have murdered somebody, or you must be covering up for something. And so there are these two very different intuitions, and I think the european one is more correct than the american one. And probably there's some history where the sort of left wing philanthropy peaked in 2000, 720, 1020, twelve.

And there's these subtle ways we've become more european in our sensibilities as a society. And so it has this very different valence from what it did twelve or 14 years ago. But, yeah, it's all we ask all these questions like we're asking right now about Bill Gates, where it's like, okay, he was, you know, it was like all the testimony in the Microsoft antitrust trial in the nineties, where he's like, he's cutting off the air supply, he wants to strangle people. And he's like, he's kind of a sociopathic guy, it seems. And then it's this giant whitewashing operation, and then somehow the whitewashing has been made too transparent, and it gets deconstructed and exposed by the Internet or whatever.

Joe Rogan

I think most people are still unaware of how much whitewashing actually took place, including donating somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 plus million dollars to media corporations, essentially buying favorable reviews about him. And then there's this very public philanthropy. It's not just philanthropy. It's philanthropy mixed with public relations, because he's constantly doing interviews about it. This is not like a guy who is just silently donating his incredible wealth to all these causes. Hes advocating for it on various talk shows. Hes constantly talking about it and how we need to do things. I mean, during the pandemic, he was a very vocal voice. He was the guy telling us he was a. Somehow or another, he became a public health expert. And no one questioned why we were taking public health advice from someone who has a financial interest in this one very particular remedy.

Peter Thiel

Yeah. Orlando, there are all these alternate versions I can give, but, yeah, I think it's always so hard to know what's really going on in our culture, though. So I think all what you say is true, but I also think it's not working as well as it used to. And there is a way people see through this. It's not always as articulate as you just articulated it, but there's some vague intuition that when Mister Gates is just wearing sweaters and looks like Mister Rogers, that something fishy is going on. People have that sort of interesting.

Joe Rogan

They trust Jeff Bezos in his tight shirt, hanging out with his girlfriend on the yacht.

Peter Thiel

More or Elon Musk. The vice signaling is safer than virtue signaling. Right. Because if you're.

You know, if you're virtue signaling, our intuition is something really, really, really sketchy, suspicious.

Joe Rogan

We get suspicious, and I think rightly so. I think, especially when someone's doing something so public, I think, rightly we should be suspicious. Especially when, I mean, with Gates, it's like, you know, the history of the guy. I mean, you know, what he was involved with before, you know, how he ran Microsoft.

You know, it just kind of makes sense that it's a clever move. It's a clever move to pay the media. It's a clever move.

Peter Thiel

Again, my alternate one, which is not incompatible with yours on Gates, is that Melinda finally files for divorce in early 21.

I think she told Bill she wanted one. Late 2019. So 2020, the year where Bill Gates goes into overdrive on Covid.

All this stuff, part of it, maybe it's self dealing and he's trying to make money from the drug company or something like this. But isn't the other really big thing he needs to box Melinda in and force her not to get that much out because all the money's going to the foundation anyway. Melinda has to say, why do you want half the money? It's all going to the gates foundation anyway. We're not leaving our kids anything.

And then when you lean into Covid, how does that work?

It's somehow, in theory, Melinda has a really strong hand. She should get half. That's what you get in a divorce with no prenuptial. But then if you make it go overdrive on Covid, Melinda, are you a. You know, are you a. I don't know.

Are you like some crazy anti science person?

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

And so I don't know.

My reconstruction is that you should not underestimate how much of it was, you know, about just controlling his ex wife and not about controlling the whole society.

Joe Rogan

Makes sense. It makes sense that you can both be true.

Peter Thiel

They can both be correct.

Joe Rogan

Sure, there's many factors, but mine.

Peter Thiel

Mine lines up really well with the. With the timeline.

Joe Rogan

Well, we're probably talking about a hundred million dollar or $100,000,000,000.01 way or the other.

Peter Thiel

Well, I think she got. She got less than. She got, like, one 10th.

Joe Rogan

Really interesting.

Peter Thiel

And she should have gotten half as far as. And I. It's amazing he got it down that much.

Joe Rogan

Wow.

Interesting.

Peter Thiel

But it was just. I think she was just boxed in. Every time he went on tv talking about COVID she was boxed in with all of her left wing friends.

Joe Rogan

That is an interesting philosophy.

That's an interesting way to approach a problem if you're him. Very wise, you know, very clever. I mean, if you're just looking at, like, just for personal benefit, the genius move and the guy's genius. Clearly. Brilliant guy, you know, I mean, that makes sense. Makes sense that he would do that.

Peter Thiel

I don't know. You know, I would do that.

Probably should have had a prenup, but.

Joe Rogan

Yeah.

Yeah. Well, that's kind of crazy. That's interesting. Yeah. I didn't consider that, but it makes sense. And she's, you know, she'd been kind of pretty vocal, unfortunately for him, about his ties to Epstein being one of the primary reasons why she wanted out.

Peter Thiel

But again, my ult. Again, it's. What did he.

Was he having extramarital affairs through Epstein? Or maybe Epstein was, from Melinda's point of view, would it be worse for Epstein to facilitate an extramarital affair, or would it be worse for Epstein to be advising Gates on how to ditch Melinda without giving her any money?

Joe Rogan

What do you think he would.

Peter Thiel

I think that would be much, much worse from Melinda's point of view.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. Makes sense. It totally makes sense. Do you think that he was a legitimate financial advisor? Like, he could give him advice on how to do those things, that gates wouldn't have more effective people? I mean, when you're at that level of wealth, I'm sure you have wealth management people that are, like, very high level, because that's one of the things that Eric said about him. He said when he met him, he was like, this guy's a fraud.

He doesn't know enough about what he's talking about. And, you know, Eric is.

Peter Thiel

You know, I met Epstein a few times as well, and I think.

Joe Rogan

How'd you get introduced?

Peter Thiel

It was. It was. Reid Hoffman in Silicon Valley introduced us in 2014. But. But it was. It was basically.

And I, you know, I didn't. Didn't check, didn't ask any. Enough questions about it.

But I think there were sort of a lot of things where it was fraudulent. I do think Epstein knew a lot about taxes, and there were probably these complicated ways you could structure a nonprofit organization, especially as a way, in a marital context, that I think Epstein might have known a decent amount about.

Joe Rogan

How, when you were introduced, I don't.

Peter Thiel

Think Epstein would have been able to comment on superstring theory, something like that.

But I think this sort of thing, he might have actually been pretty expert on.

Joe Rogan

When you were introduced to him, what. How was he described to you?

Peter Thiel

He was described as one of the smartest tax people in the world.

Joe Rogan

Interesting.

Peter Thiel

And probably was my moral weakness that I.

Joe Rogan

Well, how could you have known back then he had never been arrested?

Peter Thiel

No, this was post. This was 2014. It was post arrest.

Joe Rogan

Oh, so his arrest was the first arrest. Right.

Peter Thiel

Which was like, 2708.

Joe Rogan

Okay.

Okay. And so.

Peter Thiel

But, you know, you assume he didn't go to jail for that long.

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

It was probably not. Not as serious as alleged.

There was certainly was the illusion that there were all these.

These other people that I trusted. You know, Reid, who introduced us, was, you know, he started LinkedIn. He was, you know, maybe too focused on business networking, but I thought he always had good judgment in people.

Joe Rogan

When the shit went down and Epstein gets arrested for the second time, were you like, oh, well, there you go.

Peter Thiel

I thought a lot about it as a result.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Jesus Christ. Well, he tricked a lot of people. I know a lot of people that met that guy.

He got a lot of celebrities to come to his house for parties and things.

Peter Thiel

Well, I think. I think it was. It's. It was. It's a. I think a lot of it was. This was this strange commentary on, you know, there was some secret club, secret society you could be part of.

Joe Rogan

Right. Of course.

Peter Thiel

Again, that wasn't. It wasn't explicit, but that was. That was the vague vibe of the whole thing.

Joe Rogan

People love those stupid things. They love, like, exclusive clubs that very few people look at, the fucking Soho house. Like, look at that stupid thing. I mean, you just go to a place that you have to be a member to go to. And everybody wants to be a member. Oh, my God. And then you got, like, the Malibu Soho house. It's different from the other ones. You have to have membership only there.

Do you have membership there? People love that kind of shit socially. They love being a part of a walled garden. They love it. They love it. And if you're a guy like Bill Gates or similarly wealthy, you probably have a very small amount of people that you can relate to, very small amount of people that you can trust. Probably very difficult to form new friendships.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, I think there were probably different things that were pitched for different people.

Joe Rogan

Sure.
