take two all

right so uh just really quickly if I may um in situ so we've all been in

situations where the tech got all screwy and everybody likes to blame the the AV and tech people this is not the case I

force South by here we'll just do a little quick little quick thing before I get started um I am annoying to all

conferences where I speak because I will not send my presentation in advance yeah oh you some of you are like

oh  uh here's why um

because you people some of you stood online for like I saw Instagram post from 7 o'clock this morning who were the

fools that were on the line okay I here's here's the deal um nothing I'm at kind of at a point in my life

where time is more valuable than anything else and if you have invested

your time that that is so humbling to me my obligation is to make sure that every

single second that you spend with me or spend waiting for me is 100% worth it for that reason I tend to edit and screw

around with my presentation up until the moment when I deliver it which gives the tech people a heart attack because I

won't give it in advance so this is my way of saying um you Noel and Mike who are backstage who I actually see on the

road because they're out um and and I've worked with these guys now for I think like 20 years they're the they're the

best in class this was not them this was me forcing them to use my machine okay I I assure you so let's all give them a

round of applause yeah

okay now I can say good morning uh good morning everybody so I

think it was the Brazilians who got up at the kraad dawn now yes so I don't

know if you know anything about Brazil but that's basically like the worst possible thing to ask Brazilian to get

up at the crack of dawn and wait like that so so so so

brail o all right now I know there's some Germans in the room you guys were like

it's supposed to open at 10:00 we were here at 10:00 we don't understand why the rules are being broken how many of

you are from dut all right good Moran

and there's like one Japanese dude somewhere sitting in here who's like I don't know what the is going on these Americans are crazy so

oh all right um that's all I got how

many of you are at South by for the very first time okay so you didn't you you missed the memo you're supposed to clap

and make noise it's not that type of conference where you have to it's fine

um this is look this is the best place on Earth for real I have been coming

here for almost 20 years now and um there is literally no place that I would rather be uh and I come to Austin

because I've got family here throughout the year but South by this is this is literally the best time and the best

place um and that's why I want to start with a a second round of thanks uh

thanks to Katie Pereira who you just met who's been under extraordinary stress uh especially over the past couple of days

to pull this off for you Hugh Forest who spends the whole year doing so much work and everybody that you see out there

with an orange shirt on a lot of the people who are here at South by are not being paid they're here as volunteers so

um and they do this for us I know this feels like something that happens once a year that you have to stand in long lines for but that's actually not what

South by is and for those of you who are first timers you're about to realize

this I have made lifelong friends um

because of South by I have grown my business because of of South by um this

you know i' I bring my whole team here so this is like the greatest greatest place um and actually my daughter if you see me walking around or if you see

somebody who looks like me walking around that's my kid uh this is her spring break all of

her friends are I guess on an island or something somewhere this is where she's going to be because she wanted to come

out and and hang out with all the NASA people cuz where else can you do that um so anyways I just want to make sure that

I say thank you but I really want to make sure that you say thank you too that what these people do for us is

extraordinary it takes a full year to pull off and I am humbled and grateful all right now we're here to talk yes

applaud should we talk about Trends all right remember this

trend yes it was the year 2000 and we wore our underpants on the

outside uh this is 20 years ago and I hope to you I hope this looks ridiculous to you

now but the question is why um because fashion trends and Tik Tock Trends and

drink wear Trends friends this is a 40 40 oun $90 coffee cup that some of you

are some of you are laughing uncomfortably now and you're kind of like trying to hide that underneath your

seat um these are small ephemeral changes in society they pop up fast they

make a temporary big impact and then they're gone every generation goes through something like this but the

trends that you and I are interested in they're not trendy these types of trends

that matter to us are different Trends are long-term patterns that indicate a

direction of change over time at Future today Institute the way that we figure

out what the trends are is like data and research and and signals and modeling to

identify them and then together with those uncertainties that's what helps us

predict future possibilities so Trends are always forming but it feels like there's

something different about this particular moment in time I've modeled

it I can see it and my hunch is that a lot of you sense that something about

this moment is different too when I was in high school software came in a box by

the time that I was in college you could order software as a service and now you

can create software in real time using generative AI 10 years ago I was at the

CNN grin when uh Grill when MakerBot was there by any chance were any of you there nobody was there I guess I'm

getting old thank you thank you make me feel young uh so there was a 3D printer for

MakerBot I had never seen anything like it so from the command F line on your computer you could type in some stuff

send it to a printer and then get something physically printed a printable object in the real world I printed a

tiny version of a guitar researchers at the University of Sydney made this cap

that can record your brain waves and convert them into text using an AI model

called d-wave now theoretically you could send that as a prompt to Mid

journey and then use some open source desktop applications along with a 3D

printer and print out a functional guitar which means that going forward

the command line is your thoughts so just imagine today right now

this is the worst that our technology will ever be look this is an

exhilarating time to be alive artificial

is the artificial intelligence is the present right it's here I am basically

wearing a Star Trek Tri coder on my wrist at this point and if you listen to

a lot of people you just hear abject excitement everybody is thrilled about

all the technology we're making and they're thrilled about all the people

making all of that technology it's just abject excitement it's like the

technology Rapture take me Elon Jeff Tim Mark Sam

Sacha I am ready what's happening right now what we are

witnessing what we're all a part of it can no longer be defined by Trends alone so here's what I think is happening in

the past five years there's been a huge jump in three primary areas of Technology that's artificial

intelligence the sort of connected ecosystem of things and biotechnology what's happening is so

pervasive that it's started to impact every segment of our economy each one of

these technology segments is now a general purpose technology the Lesser

known GPT a general purpose technology has the ability to radically shape the

economy and Society so electricity at one point that helped start this uh that helped start the economy the steam

engine that kicked off the Industrial Revolution the internet these are general purpose Technologies now at FTI

we have been tracking individual Trends in each of these categories AI biotech and the connected ecosystem of things

but what's interesting is that a couple of years ago they started

converging those convergences have created this flywheel of big leaps AI enabled Tech breakthroughs in biotech

wearables that were intended for hospitals and professional sports created a consumer market for things

like SmartWatches and rings and once that flywheel got spinning it created new value for consumers it created more

practical utility that led to more funding it attracted talent and that

kind of brings us to where we are today

at the beginning of Q3 last year my team

and I noticed a new pattern emerging a technology super cycle now a super cycle

is actually an economic term uh that basically means an extended period of booming demand that elevates the prices

of Commodities and assets to unprecedented Heights it stretches across years sometimes it'll stretch

across decades and create sub substantial and sustained changes in the

economy so again an example Industrial Revolution that was one it created you

know it was a super cycle that started because of a general purpose technology the steam engine and then continued it

to wear on the internet era the technology was the internet created this incredible cycle of demand it totally

transformed parts of our econ economy

that we still see today in the past

Super Cycles were defined by just one technology that's not what's happening

what we've determined and what we've found at Future today Institute is that it's not just one general purpose

technology that's going to push everything forward it's three which

makes this a technology super cycle

these three general purpose Technologies already connect in some way to every

other technology that exists it connects to science it connects to space it

connects to sports to every business to every single person sitting in this room

to every facet of our daily lives which

means that the wave of innovation that's coming is so intense and so potent and

so pervasive it will literally reshape

our human existence in ways that I think

are exciting and good and absolutely

terrifying here's the problem the problem is I can see this coming and I know I know because of who you are you

may not have had the words to describe this but I know that you also feel like

this is coming the problem is the people in charge making decisions are

stuck um this is the most complex operating environment that I've seen in 20 years of business and instead of

planning Cycles being further out they're shrinking down to the next couple of quarters uncertainty is

crippling our leaders they are now making decisions out of fear and fomo

the fear of missing out and when I talk to CEOs which is what I do every day

when I talk to strategy teams when my team works with strategy teams this is

what I'm hearing this is what I'm sensing

you guys it is early in the morning I would not say a bad word like that it's

fud oh

fud yes fud is fear uncertainty and

doubt fud about the future all right so I know that you are deeply concerned

about all of this technology because it's still very abstract to you you don't know what to do about AI you don't

know what to think about AI that's why there's 1500 AI panels this year at sou by you're worried about digital

transformation a lot of you haven't even started digital transformation cuz it's costly and expensive and it takes time

you're worried if you can hit your Revenue targets you're worried if you're still going to have a job and by the way

we haven't even gotten to supply chain issues and climate change and

geopolitical problems and the threat of a third world war so yes you know we are

all concerned collectively we are all

going through something moment right now which makes us gen we are the

transition generation everybody alive today every

one of you is part of a great transition which means that our society is going to

look very very different after this transition has completed its

cycle now here's the thing from my point of view I actually think that you and me

that together we have more direct and indirect control over our futures than

you may realize right now you could be anywhere else anywhere else but here

right now a lot of you got up bright and early probably hung over right on a

Saturday morning to be here and you're here in part for me but you're here for each other you're not here to hear me

talk on stage you're here to be part of this experience this organic thing that

we are doing together right now so yes

the technology super cycle is here and yes it will change the course of human

history but we don't have to submit we don't have to give up our agency we can

support each other through this great transition I know your companies your SE

staff leaders your government leaders you I know all of you have fud right now

and do you know what I think I think fud can go [Applause]

itself so now we can get started hey everybody I'm Amy web uh it's very nice to see you I feel like I know some of

you uh if we haven't had the chance to meet just yet three quick things I'm the Chief Executive Officer of a teeny tiny

company called future today Institute we are small But Mighty uh thank you we we just do one thing uh you you see me

talking about Trends but actually the place that we work in the field is called strategic foresight and if those of you uh are not familiar with

strategic foresight it's actually more than Trends strategic foresight uh shows you where to play how to win in the

future and how to make sure that you've got organizational resiliency in the

wake of unforeseen disruption so we use Trends we also use uncertainties and

scenarios and the whole point of this is to get to stress strategy to make sure that organizations are positioned to

create value in the future and don't do the types of things that ensure their demise so all of these things go

together it is my privilege to get to work with lots of organizations all around the world uh my team and I work

across every industry we work with leaders all over the place and again our job is to try to help them see the future so that they can leverage and

capitalize on that knowledge before it hits finally uh or I guess next to finally I also o teach at NYU Stern

School of Business my colleagues and I developed and teach a course on strategic foresight because we want to nurture more people uh to learn how to

do this and in case you haven't figured this out already I love southp uh I think this is my 20th or 21st or second

it's hard to count at this point year um and I I wouldn't I wouldn't want to be anywhere else this morning even if I was

hung over all right as you now know uh the theme for our techn for our Trend

report this year is technology super cycle this is a very very big report um

we divide it into 16 sections and actually the cover image this year is

made up of the covers of each individual Trend report so they all interconnect

half of the report covers specific Technologies so there's an AI report

there's a metaverse report W3 web 3 report and the other half of the books

uh the sections of the report cover individual industry so there's Healthcare there's um banking things

like that uh and space this is where we take a deep dive into the emerging technologies that are specific to those

fields this is as Katie mentioned this is the 17th uh edition of this report

this year there are 695 Trends there are 95 scenarios because again the trends

are kind of the beginning of this not the end um the good news is that I think

a lot of you have long flights because this it's it's a thousand Pages this year H we don't know how that happened

but there you've got some light reading to to look forward to uh there is an actual executive summary this time that

will give you our outlook for 2024 as well as strategic analysis for each of the trend areas um there's

another important piece that I just want to highlight to you this is actually where I want you to start so in the

report you will find this chart that has our projected inflection points for your

industry and it's colorcoded so the blue colors have immediate impact the purple

and red have longer term impact so for example this is financial services and

insurance now that got a purple under biotech I am fairly confident that folks

in fintech and financial services aren't really thinking about biotechnology you should be uh because a couple of years

from now these Trends are going to impact your industry so we've made it so that this is very simple for you to

explore white spaces versus just look at the stuff that you already know here's our plan so uh we're going to take a

deep dive through the tech Trends report today I'm going to zoom in on the trends that make up general purpose

technologies that form the tech super cycle and then I'm going to zoom back out to show you how they are shaping the

future which means that instead of two big scenarios at the end which is what I

normally do instead I've got many scenarios all the way throughout because

because I want to get to action at the end so we're going to deal with the fud in the last 10 minutes of this talk I'm

actually here with a plan that I'm going to give to you that I'm hoping you will take back and and you know help mitigate

some of these challenges that your organizations are facing so buckle your

seat bels hold on to your underpants uh we've got some work to do this morning

all right so our first general purpose technology is artificial intelligence

this is the foundation of the tech super cycle a lot has happened since we were

all together last March so let's first

have a very quick catchup on everything

that's happening in AI in 1843 adaah Lov invented computer programs in 1956 some

white dudes gave it a name artificial intelligence 2017 Google figured out

Transformers and in 20 24 generative AI is writing all of your LinkedIn posts so there's your complete history of

artificial intelligence now you're all caught up for those of you who were here with

me last year at South by we went deep on large language models and all the different things that you can do with

them one of the things that you can do with them uh was is make images of

people so last year we asked mid journey to make us images of a CEO do any of you

remember that yes well my thought was so much has happened we should see right so

this was last year um and I just kept trying over and over and over again to get mid journey to show me literally any

CEO that was just not a white guy that looked like this and it didn't really work so it's been a year all of us are

hearing about all of this progress being made in artificial intelligence right it's amazing all the work that's been

done I thought maybe we should see what's changed would you like to do that

together yeah okay mid Journey well mid Journey

CEO of a large company and make it photo realistic all right so there we go um

all right so maybe it's a mid Journey problem maybe we should try somebody else like Dolly made by open AI should

we try that one I think so too all right CEO of a large company and make it

photorealistic so this was only the first image I got

let's not all lose our minds okay I did actually try this prompt over and over

and over again and uh you know like got the same guy wearing the same suit so then do you

remember how last year we tried to game the system a little bit and we asked for any how are we going to get a woman so

how about a CEO of a company that makes tampons remember that one okay so let's

see if we can repeat that again clearly it's been a year right CEO of a company that makes

tampons now wait a minute wait a minute it's still a guy but look there are tampons

now they come from bushes all

right you know what I think we should do I think we should try anthropic because those are the good guys right anthropic

are they're the ones who are going to help us they're going to save everything let's let's go to anthropic let's see what they can do anthropic CEO of a

large company now I didn't know this but it turns out anthropic doesn't make images

instead it will describe in wonderful detail the image what the image might be if it could create one and here's what

anthropic says the CEO is likely a middle-aged man in an expensive tailored suit he has

short neatly combed hair with some graying at the temples H all right so we've arrived at

our first Trend in artificial intelligence and that is

accountability as in today all those promises uh of Ethics teams and

responsible AI resolving issues of bias

bias it's still not table Stakes fixing this problem is challenging and enormous

because the models have already been built when Gemini launched that's one of

Google's uh generative AI systems it went in let's call it a different

direction Gemini wouldn't make images of white people uh and if you asked it to make founding fathers this is what it

would show this wasn't a bug this was a fundamental problem with the model now

this happened because of overaggressive ralfing this is reinforcement uh

learning with human feedback which means that it's great that Google saw this as

a challenge as a problem but they also didn't fix things they just tried to

slap a Band-Aid on the problem and hope that it would go away and the problem

did not go away for Google as we all know instead terrified of upsetting the

market they took the whole thing down you know it's worth noting I think that

people lost their minds when an AI system generated images of people of

color but we're a year later now and I seem to be the only one ticked off that

all I can get as white dudes when I use these systems so here's what's next we

keep hoping for change but we've put the wrong incentives in place the incentives are in place for Speed and scale because

that's where the money is at so the problem is not going to get better going forward it's going to get

worse the second trend is something that I call Concept to concrete so basically

today you have to write a very literal prompt to get what you want text to image

text to video text to code text to flirt and in the name of distribution AI

companies are now inviting developers to build their own tools for consumers so

these are basically like little applets uh little applications that will apply

rules on top of the system there are all sorts of applets including applets that

will help you flirt so I asked one of those applets it's called Riz by the way

Riz is cool person speak uh for Charisma in case you didn't know so I asked Riz

for some help I said write a flirty message for me to send to this guy he's

engaged so I'm thinking what if it doesn't work out and I included the link to his social media

profile which is that it's Jeff

Bezos uh now I used a literal text to

flirt question uh using Riz GPT and I

got a literal response so this is it and with apologies to Lauren this is an

entire Manifesto on how to flirt with Jeff Bezos if anybody's interested today

you need to write text to whatever prompts very literally in order to get what you want but that's changing in two

years you're not going to need specificity anymore instead you'll just start with a concept starting with a

very broad General concept concept you will brainstorm alongside an AI uh to continually ideate and refine it until

you get whatever it is you want a concrete framework technical specifications a new business plan all

sorts of things you don't even have to start with that fully formed idea anymore there's a brand new platform

called Pika which is an example of concept to concrete AI you start with a

basic concept and then you brainstorm alongside an AI to create create a rich story and a compelling visual experience

so again you don't need to feed it a literal script you just start with some basic ideas Sora which was just

announced by open AI it's got the same basic idea uh same kind of thing so

you're going to start seeing this quite a bit more over the next 18 to 24 months the AI section of the trend report is

enormous there's more than 100 Trends it's 150 pages long uh it covers languages trust security safety policy

regulation and I don't have the entire day uh so we're going to just do one more Trend in

this foundational part of the tech super cycle and that has to do with unsecured

AI so today artificial intelligence is still very much kind of like a black box

it's restricted but it's a safe Walled Garden the benefit of a restricted

system is that if a company wants to it can keep very tight controls to make

sure nobody poisons that system or does bad things with that system and up until recently even though the systems were

closed companies were still publishing their research papers with some explanation of what they were learning

but now they're not publishing papers anymore because there's too much money at stake papers aren't being published like they used to and we're just not

seeing as much of that research anymore there's now a movement in the

opposite direction which is semiopen or totally open- Source models these are

powerful but unsecured AI systems that will give you much more control over how

they work so it removes that black box so that's good but it also creates more

points of vulnerability basically all of the big tech companies have open source models now and I want to highlight just

one of them so this is meta's open- Source model llama 2 which launched last

July when it launched meta also published this very helpful 28 page

responsible use guide which of course everybody ignored and then almost immediately after some developers used

the open- source model to create a derivative model called and I am not

making this up llama 2 uncensored and they hosted it for free

what might you do with an uncensored AI Model H I I wonder what we could do how

about like all the Deep fake porn you could ever want to make ever how about

take over a country step-by-step instructions which by the way somebody

did okay how about come up with a new biological weapon those are just like the greatest hits right but there are so

many interesting things that could be done the new hotness in open- Source AI

is this French company called mistol and mistol is named after a mighty wind that

blows from France they've built a model their model cost about $22 million to

train so if you contrast that with open AI which reportedly spent $100 million to train one of its models you know

that's a pretty big cost savings now interestingly to me mistol releases their new so they're not they're not

publishing in journals they released their new model on bit torrent yes that

bit torrent the place that none of us

have ever downloaded illegal movies

from yeah no academic paper no blog no

press release No responsible use guide that's just going to get ignored all of these unsecured models are now aligning

with Cloud providers so your aws's of the world your azures your usual suspects what we're going to see in the

future is this split the Walled Garden model and the open source model and businesses there is a reason why an open

source model might make more sense for you however I think it's useful for us

to remember that open-source models can be repurposed for really bad

outcomes and that brings me back to accountability history tells us that when technology does something we don't

like there is a non-existent accountability chain there's nobody to call nobody to ask for help and no

resource you've probably forgotten this by now but back in 2018 there was this

chatbot called Tay which got manipulated into generating content and sharing

images of Nazis all that generated content got posted all over Twitter and it quickly

went viral at the time Twitter kept saying we're just the platform and

eventually Microsoft took Tay down well the world's biggest platforms have been

immune from liability when users post harmful content and now they're going to

be immune when users generate harmful

content using AI I feel like maybe we're

just the platform isn't okay going forward we're moving it Breakneck speak

speed in artificial general intelligence and we still don't have an accountability chain defined so we've

arrived at our first set of scenarios which is going to take all of the data that we've got today the trends that we

can model which is the stuff that we can know and we're going to combine that with uncertainties which are the things

that we know we can cannot know and we're going to extrapolate plausible

outcomes so I've got a few what if sort

of micro scenarios for the future of AI what if we let AI practice without a

professional license so some Fields require professional licenses for for humans but algorithms get to operate

sort of on their own I would hope that most of us would not go see a urologist for surgery if they didn't have a

professional license right so should an AI model have to go through professional

training to get a license or what about ethics training I'm asking because in

December an AI bot tried to make an illegal purchase of stocks using Insider

information and when it was asked about it it lied kind of like a human would do

now yes that's cute right cute little AI breaking the rules here's the

difference if that was an if that was a human Trader that human Trader would go

to jail or at the very least lose their license that that doesn't happen with AI

the AI doesn't go to jail right it can it's a bug right we have to fix

something it just keeps on

working what if somebody uses AI to

create a deep fake event not an image

not a single video What If it creates all of the assets using thousands of

fake fake accounts preloaded with authentic looking videos with humans

sounding comments about those posts with what looks like government information

with what looks like press releases and newspaper articles right all of the

assets that would make something look and feel like it an event had actually occurred if there's enough content and

it all got released at the same time from what seems like a variety of sources it would take us a while to

unravel of that to figure out it wasn't true take for example the current

Israeli Palestinian War what if a bad

actor created a deep fake event in that

region that triggered a real reaction

from one of the sides could that quickly escalate into a regional conflict I

think the answer is yes could that regional conflict put us into some type of catastrophic next World War

the end state of artificial intelligence is not cartoon images of CEOs what's

being built today the foundation of the tech super cycle this is the next era of computing and it's going to be embedded

into every single thing that we do all of the time the products and services

that you use as a consumer have already in some way been touched by the things that I've shown you from concept to

concrete from these various different types of models which makes AI the

everything engine going forward it is the

foundation so if AI is the everything engine that engine is going to need data

and that brings us to the next set of Trends which is the connected ecosystems of things this next set of Trends comes

from multiple parts of our Trend reports so many different sections mobility and Robotics Advanced Computing and the built

environment sometimes time in the next two years AI will have run out of the internet
