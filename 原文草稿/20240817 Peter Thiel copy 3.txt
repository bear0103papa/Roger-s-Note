Peter Thiel

You know, I was pitched on the taxes. I think, you know, there were probably other people that were more prone to the, you know, the social club.

And then there were probably people. Yeah. And there was probably a fairly limited group where it was. Yeah. Off the charts bad stuff.

Joe Rogan

Wouldn't it be wonderful to know what the fuck was really going on? And maybe one day we will. Maybe one day day some Whitney Webb type character will break it all down to us and explain to us in great detail exactly how this is formulated and what they were doing and how they were getting information out of people. But I think people have to age out.

Peter Thiel

They have to die, and we still don't have it. On the Kennedy assassination, JFK.

Joe Rogan

Well, one of the wildest things that Trump said was that if they told you what they told me, you wouldn't tell people either, which is like, what the fuck does that mean?

What does that mean? I don't think legally he can tell you. Right. Because I think those things are above top secret. If they did inform him of something, there must be some sort of prerequisite to keeping this a secret.

Peter Thiel

I haven't studied that one that carefully. But isn't, you know, there are all these alternate conspiracy theories on who killed JFK. It's, you know, the CIA and the Mafia and the Russians and the Cubans and, you know, there's an LBJ version since he's the one who benefited. So all these happened in Texas.

You have all these, you know, alternate theories. On some level. It's. Yeah, I always think it's just a commentary where, you know, 1963, America was. It wasn't like leave it to beaver.

It was like a really crazy country underneath the surface.

Joe Rogan

Absolutely.

Peter Thiel

And even though probably most of the conspiracy theories are wrong, it was like murder on the Orient Express. And all these people sort of had different reasons for wanting Kennedy dead. And that's what the theories are right. Even if they're wrong on the level of factual detail and then the sort of more minimal one that I'm open to.

And I think there's some evidence in this from the stuff that has been. That has come out is, you know, Oswald was talking to, you know, parts of the US deep state. And so even if Oswald was the lone assassin and you somehow get the magic bullet theory and all that stuff to work, but let's say Oswald was the lone assassin.

Did he tell someone in the FBI or Ciataine, you know, I'm going to go kill Kennedy tomorrow, and then, you know, maybe. Maybe the CIA didn't have to kill him. They just didn't. Had to do nothing, just had to sit on it. Or maybe he was too incompetent and didn't get, you know, didn't go up the bureaucracy. And so it's, you know, I think we sort of know that they talked to Oswald a fair amount before. Before it happened. And so there's at least something, you know, that was grossly incompetent.

Joe Rogan

I think people have a problem at a very minimum, with two stories being mutually exclusive. Two stories being the lone gunman or the CIA killed Kennedy and that they're not connected. I think Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of it.

I think he probably did shoot that cop. There's some evidence that when he was on the run and he was confronted, you know, there was a cop that got shot, and they were alleging he might have done it. He might have taken a shot at Kennedy. He might have even hit him. I don't think he was the only one shooting. I think the vast.

There was an enormous amount of people that heard sounds coming from the grassy knoll. They heard gunfire. They reportedly saw people. The amount of people that were witnesses to the Kennedy assassination that died mysterious deaths is pretty shocking.

Peter Thiel

Jack Ruby.

Joe Rogan

Well, Jack Ruby just. That's a weird one, right?

Peter Thiel

Oswald.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, Jack Ruby walks up to Oswald, shoots him. And then Jack Ruby, with no previous history of mental illness, becomes completely insane after getting visited by Jolly west, which is nuts. Like, why is the guy who's the head of Mkultra visiting the guy who shot the assassin of the president? And why is he left alone with them? What happens? What does he give him that this guy is screaming out there, burning jews alive and just crazy, crazy shit. He was yelling out. He went nuts.

Peter Thiel

Probably some amount of LSD that's probably dangerous for you.

Joe Rogan

Enormous amounts of fucking glass of it. They probably gave him a glass of it and told him it was water. Drink this and who fucking knows? But the point is, I think it's very possible that Oswald was a part of it.

The way they did it and the way they just shot Oswald.

And then they write the Warren commission. We don't even see the Zapruder film until twelve years later when Geraldo Rivera, when they play it on television, when Dick Gregory brought it to Geraldo Rivera, which is wild, a comedian brings the video, the actual film, rather, of the assassination, from a different angle. Well, you can actually see the video of him getting shot. His head snaps back into the left and everybody's like, what the fuck is going on here?

When you look at all that stuff, this mirrors what happened with this crooks kid.

This crooks kid, somehow or another gets to the top of the roof, is spotted by these people. They know he's there, they know he has a rifle. They see him walking around the crime scene half an hour before with a rangefinder.

The whole thing is bananas. And then they go to his house after hes killed. Its completely scrubbed. Theres no silverware there. They know that theres ad data that shows that a phone thats coming from the FBI offices in DC had visited him on multiple occasions because they tracked ad data.

And if that guy, if he shot Trump, and Trump got murdered and then they shot him, it would be the Kennedy assassination all over again. Everybody would go, and what the fuck happened? What happened? What was the motivation? What was he on any drugs? What's the toxicology report? How did he get up there? Who knew he was up there? How did they not shoot him quicker? Like, what the fuck happened? How was he able to get off three shots? What happened?

Peter Thiel

And I think there's like a slightly less crazy version that might still be true, which is just that people in the secret service, in the Biden administration don't like Trump, and it's, they didn't have full intention to kill him, but it's just, they don't protect him. We're just, we're just, you know, we're gonna have, we're gonna understaff it. We're, we're not gonna, we don't have to do as good a job coordinating with the local police.

There's all these ways, you know, to.

Joe Rogan

Make someone less safe, you know, but it seems more than that. If they, if they knew that the guy was on the roof with a rifle, that seems a little more than that.

Peter Thiel

It's always a question who they is, though, right?

Joe Rogan

Well, if I'm a sniper and I'm.

Peter Thiel

On people in the audience, there were people there telling it to people.

Joe Rogan

Right. But I think the authorities knew this guy was on the roof before as well.

Peter Thiel

Well, I suspect some of the Secret Service people were told that and then who knows how that got relayed or who all.

Joe Rogan

Well, did all snipers already have eye on him? I believe the snipers already had eye.

Peter Thiel

I don't know.

Joe Rogan

Find out if that's true, Jamie. Find out the snipers had eye on secret Service.

Peter Thiel

That I don't know about the snipers.

I don't know about.

The thing I don't have a good sense on with shooting. And maybe you'd have a better feel for. This is my sense. It was a pretty straightforward shot for the guy in the Trump assassin would be assassin.

I think the Oswald shot was a much harder one because Kennedy's moving.

Joe Rogan

Yes and no. Yes and no. Okay. Because Oswald had a scope. So Oswald had a rifle. The Marcano rifle.

One of the snipers stationed inside the building reported he first saw Crooks outside and looking up to the roof of the building before the suspect left the scene. Crooks later came back and sat down while looking at his phone near the building. CB's news reported that a sniper took a photo of the suspect when he returned. But I think they saw him on the roof though.

Crooks then took out a rangefinder, like, right then. Arrest that guy. You got a fucking rangefinder? About the suspect's action, Crooks then disappeared again and returned to the building with a backpack. Again. Arrest him. Secret Service snipers again alerted their command post about Crooks actions. According to the source who spoke with CB's news, Crooks had already climbed to the top of the building in question by the time additional officers arrived at the scene for backup. The suspect also positioned himself above and behind the snipers inside the building. By the time the police started rushing the scene and other officers attempted to get onto the roof, the source told CB's News that a different secret service sniper had killed crooks.

Okay, so it seems like they fucking bumbled it at every step of the way. If they knew that guy was there, if they knew he had arranged finder returns to the backpack, he gets onto the roof. All that's insane. That is, at the very least, horrific incompetence. At the very least.

Peter Thiel

Let me go back. Yeah, okay. But back to Mike, was it? I thought it was a much easier shot for.

Joe Rogan

It's not an easy headshot.

He's shooting at his head.

Peter Thiel

But why was shooting it that had the right thing? Shouldn't you be shooting it?

Joe Rogan

Well, you don't know if he's wearing a vest, right?

He could be wearing a vest, which you would have to have plates. You'd have to have ceramic plates in order to stop rifle round.

So was. Was it a 308? What did he have?

What kind of rifle did he have?

I think he had an AR 15.

So.

Peter Thiel

And are the scopes a lot better.

Joe Rogan

Today than our scope? Which we're pretty sure.

Peter Thiel

How good is all Oswald scope?

Joe Rogan

It was good. They said it was off. This is one of the conspiracy theories. Oh, but the scope was off. But that doesn't mean anything because scopes can get off when you pick it up. If you knock it against the wall. When he drops it. If he makes the shot and then drops the scope and the scope hits the window. Window sill and then bounces off. That's. Excuse me. That scopes off anytime.

Peter Thiel

Was there anything about the high angle from Oswald that made it harder?

Joe Rogan

No, not a difficult shot. It's very difficult to get off three shots very quickly. So that was the thing that they had attributed three shots to Oswald. The reason why they had attributed three shots is because one of them had hit a ricochet. One of them had gone into the underpass, ricocheted off the curb, and hit a man who was treated at hospital. They found that. They found out where it hit. The bullet had hit. So they knew that one bullet missed Kennedy hit that curb, which would have indicated that someone shot from a similar position as Lee Harvey Oswald.

So then they had the one wound that Kennedy had to the head, of course. And then they had another wound that Kennedy had through his neck.

Peter Thiel

That's the magic bullet theory.

Joe Rogan

This is why they had to come up with the magic bullet theory. Because they had to attribute all these wounds to one bullet. And then they find this pristine bullet. They find it in the gurney when they're bringing Governor Connally in.

Nonsense. It's total nonsense. The bullet is undeformed. A bullet that goes through two people and leaves more fragments of the bullet in Connally's wrist than are missing from the bullet itself. And then the bullet's not deformed after shattering bone.

All that's crazy. All that defies logic. That doesn't make any sense if you know anything about bullets and if you shoot bullets into things, they distorted. It's just one of the things that happened.

That bullet looks like someone shot it into a swimming pool. That's what it looks like when they do ballistics on bullets and they try to figure out, like, if it was this guy's gun or that guy's gun. And by the rifling of the round, they can get similar markings on bullets when they do that. That's how they do it. They do it so the bullet doesn't distort. So they shoot that bullet into water or something like that. Now, that bullet was metal jacketed, right? If you look at the bullet, the top of it is fucked up, but the shape of the bullet looks pretty perfect.

It doesn't look like something that shattered bones. And then you have to attribute. You have to account, rather, for the amount of.

There's little fragments of the bullet that you could see that they found in Connally's wrist. The whole thing's nuts. The whole thing's nuts that you're only saying that this one guy did it because that's convenient. And the Warren Commission's.

Peter Thiel

The Warren commission whitewashed everything.

Joe Rogan

The whole thing's nuts. It's much more likely that there were people in the grassy knoll and then.

Peter Thiel

Obviously with the umbrellas as the pointers or whatever.

Joe Rogan

I mean, I don't know. I don't know about what. All I know is you got a guy in a convertible, which is fucking crazy, who is the president of the United States, and he's going slowly down a road. Now, if you are in a prone position. So Oswald is on the windowsill. Right? Which is a great place to shoot, by the way. It's a great place to shoot. Cause you rest that gun on the windowsill, and once you rest it on the windowsill, there's no movement, right? So you wrap your arm around the sling. If it had a sling. I'm not sure if it did. So you get a nice tight grip, you shove it up against your shoulder, you rest it on the window sill. And all you have to do is you have a round already racked, and you have a scope. And so the scope's magnified. All you have to do is wait until he's there. You lead him just a little bit and squeeze one off. And then boom, boom. You could do that pretty quick.

It's not outside of the realm of possibility that he did get off three shots. What doesn't make sense is the back and to the left. It doesn't make sense that all these other people saw people shooting from the grassy knoll. There's all these people that saw people running away. They saw smoke. There's smoke in some photographs of it. It looks like there was more than one shooter. And it looks like they tried to. They tried to hide that. They tried to hide that in the Warren commission report, the shot to Kennedys neck initially was in when they brought him in in Dallas before they shipped him to Bethesda. They said that that was an entry wound. When he got to Bethesda, then it became a tracheotomy. Why do you give a tracheotomy to a guy who doesnt have a head? You dont. I mean, none of it makes any sense. They altered the autopsy.

This is a part of David Liftons book, best evidence.

Kennedy's brain wasn't even in his body when they buried him. Like, the whole thing is very strange.

Peter Thiel

But then do you get to anything more concrete than my murder on the Orient Express, where they're just, you know, it could have been a lot of people, the Cubans, the suspicious for twelve years, I think people were suspicious, kind of.

Joe Rogan

But what do you have to go on? You don't have to go on anything like this. Crooks, kidde, we dont have anything to go on. Were just going to be left out here just like were left out here with the Epstein information. No one knows the people that, whoever organized it, if anyone did, youre never going to hear about it. Its just going to go away. The news cycle is just going to keep flooded with more nonsense.

I think theres probably a bunch of people that wanted Kennedy dead. I think there was more than one group of people that wanted Kennedy dead. I think theres probably collusion between groups that wanted Kennedy dead. And I think there's a lot of people that have vested interest in ending his presidency. And I think he was dangerous. He was dangerous to a lot of powers that be. He was dangerous. His famous speech about secret societies, crazy speech. The guy has this speech and then gets murdered right afterwards. Kind of nuts. The whole thing's nuts. He wanted to get rid of the CIA. He wanted to. I mean, there were so many things that Kennedy wanted to do.

Peter Thiel

There were also a lot of crazy things Kennedy was doing.

The Cuba version of the assassination theory was we had the cuban missile crisis in 62, about a year earlier. And then the deal that we struck with the Soviets was they take the missiles out of Cuba and we promised we wouldn't try to overthrow the government in Cuba.

You know, we no longer did, you know, we no longer did bay of pigs type covert stuff like that. But I think there were still something like four or five assassination plots on Fidel.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, attempts, actual attempts.

Peter Thiel

And then I think there was. I don't know, I think, again, I'm going to get this garbled. I think a month or two before the JFK assassination, Castro said something like, you know, there might be repercussions if you keep doing this.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, well, listen, I'm sure there's a lot of people that wanted that guy dead, and I'm sure they would coordinate. I mean, if you knew that Cuba wanted Kennedy dead and you knew that Cuba can get you assassins or that they could help in any way, I'm sure they would want as many people that knew for a fact they wanted him dead and had communicated that. I mean, back then, they were doing wild shit, man. I mean, this is when they were doing Operation Northwoods.

Peter Thiel

This is, again, where I think I. I think. I think it is.

I don't think we're in a world where zero stuff is happening.

The place where I directionally have a different feel for it is, I think so much less of the stuff is going on. And it's so much harder in this Internet world for people to hide with whistleblowers as well and their legacy programs and their internal records that are being kept. And, you know, like, I don't know this for sure, but I think even the NSA FISA court stuff, which was an out of control deep state thing that was going on through about 2016, 2017. I suspect even that at this point, you know, can't quite work because people know that they're being watched, they know they're being recorded. And it's just, you know, you can't do waterboarding in Guantanamo if you have lawyers running all over the place.

I hope you're correct.

Joe Rogan

I hope you're correct. But it brings me back to this whole idea of getting dirty.

Peter Thiel

But then I think there's. And then, on the other hand, there's also a degree to which our government, our deep state across the board, is shockingly less competent, less functional, and it's less capable of this. And this is where I'm not even sure whether this is an improvement.

So it's sort of like maybe the 1963 us where.

Let's go with the craziest version, where our deep state is capable of knocking off the president.

Maybe that's actually a higher functioning society than the.

Then the crazy version where they're. They're incapable of doing it right and.

Joe Rogan

They'Re bogged down with Dei.

Peter Thiel

They can't. They can't. They can't get the gunman even to have a scope on his rifle or whatever.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I don't. We don't. We haven't really.

Peter Thiel

I mean, it's like, what?

Joe Rogan

His rifle? But I don't believe he did, man.

Peter Thiel

It's like. It's like much bigger loser. Can you find someone as competent as Oswald?

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

Or something like that, you know?

Joe Rogan

Yeah, that's a good point. It's a good point.

Peter Thiel

So I veer more to the explanation that it's gross incompetence, but I don't know if that makes it better. It might make it worse.

Joe Rogan

I think they weren't as competent. Right. Because they only had one guy doing it, and he wasn't effective. If you had the same. If you had much better organization, you wouldn't have just one guy. I mean, there's people out there that I know that can kill someone from a mile away, but it's very effective.

Peter Thiel

You can do things as a solo actor. It's hard to organize because everything gets recorded.

Joe Rogan

Everything does get recorded. That is a fact. But it brings me back to that thing about having dirt on people that you were talking about with why the Epstein information doesn't get released and why they probably did it in the first place. They did it in the first place. You have dirt on people, then you know those people are not going to tell on you.

Peter Thiel

And there's all that is.

That is still a strange counterpoint to my thesis. Why has the dirt not come out? And so somehow there's some. Some way the container is still kind of working.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, it's kind of working. It's just everyone is aware that it's working, and then they're frustrated that nothing happens. You know, like Jillian Assange being arrested and spending so much time locked up in the embassy, like, finally recently released. But didn't he have to delete, like, a bunch of emails in order to be released?

Peter Thiel

You know, in the. But again, just. Just to take the other side of this, both in the Assange Snowden stuff.

Yeah. It showed an out of control deep state that was just hoovering up all the data in the world.

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

And then. But we weren't like, it didn't show, like, James Bond times 100. There weren't, like, exploding cigar assassination plots. There was none of.

We're doing so little with this is.

Or at least that's the.

But you know, I think there's so much less agency in the CIA, in the Central Intelligence Agency. It's so much less agentic.

Joe Rogan

I hope you're right.

Peter Thiel

Again, I don't know.

Joe Rogan

I don't know if that's incorrect with how they deal with overseas stuff. I hope they're really good at that.

You know, that brings me to this whole UAP thing, because one of my primary theories about the UAP thing is it's stuff that we have.

I think that's a lot of what people are seeing. I think there are secret programs that are beyond congressional oversight that have done some things with propulsion that's outside of our understanding, our current, the conventional understanding that most people have about rockets and all these different things being the only way to propel things through the sky. I think they've figured out some other stuff, and I think they're drones, and I think they have drones that can use some sort of, whether it's anti gravity propulsion system or some, you know, so do that's.

Peter Thiel

That's your, that's your placeholder theory, or that's. That's, uh. That's what you think more than space aliens, or do you think both space aliens and that, or which. Which version?

Joe Rogan

The latter. I think both.

Peter Thiel

Think both.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. I don't. I don't think we haven't been visited. I think we have. I think we. If life exists elsewhere, and it most certainly should, it just makes sense.

Peter Thiel

But do you think.

Do you think the UFO sightings from the fifties and sixties were already drone programs? Were they already that advanced?

Joe Rogan

No, those are the ones that give me pause. That's why, you know, when I named my comedy club the comedy Mothership is all UFO themed. Our rooms are named fat man and little boy. Our rooms are named after the nuclear bombs, because those nuclear bombs, when they drop them, that's when everybody starts seeing these things. And I think if I was a sophisticated society from another planet, and I recognized that there is an intelligent species that has developed nuclear power and has started using it as bombs, I would immediately start visiting and I would let them know, hey, motherfuckers, there's something way more advanced than you. I would hover over the nuclear bases and shut down their missiles. I would do all the things that supposedly the UFO's did just to keep the government in check, just to say, hey, you are going through a transitionary period that all intelligent species do when they have the ability to harness incredible power, and yet they still have these primate brains, they have these territorial ape brains, but yet now with the ability to literally harness the power of stars and drop them on cities, I think that's when I would start visiting. And I think all throughout human history before that even, there's been very bizarre accounts of these things, all the way back to Ezekiel in the Bible. Very bizarre accounts of these things that are flying through space.

Peter Thiel

The story of the chariot. Yep.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, there's a bunch of them. There's the Vimanas and the ancient hindu texts. There's so many of these things that you got to wonder, and you got to think that if we send drones to Mars, and we do, we have a fucking rover running around on Mars right now collecting data. Do we send the James Webb telescope into space? Of course we do. We have a lot of stuff that we send into space. If we lived another million years without blowing ourselves up, which is just a blink of an eye in terms of the life of some of the planets in the universe, how much more advanced would we be? And if we were interstellar, and if we were intergalactic travelers and we found out that there was a primitive species that was coming of age, I think we would start visiting them.

Peter Thiel

You know, the.

Let me think what my.

I hear everything you're saying.

I'm strangely undermotivated by it, even.

Joe Rogan

Me too.

Peter Thiel

Even if it's plausible.

Joe Rogan

Me too, believe it or not.

Peter Thiel

And I guess on the space aliens, which is the wilder, more interesting one in a way. You know, I don't know. Roswell was 77 years ago, 1947. And if the phenomenon is real and it's from another world, it's space aliens, space robots, whatever.

Probably one of the key features is its ephemerality or its cloaking, and they are really good at hiding it, at cloaking it, at scrambling people's brains after they see them or stuff like this. And then if you're a researcher, you have to pick fields where you can make progress. And so this is. It's not a promising field.

I know academia is messed up, but even if academia were not messed up, this would not be a good field in which to try to make a career, because there's been so little progress in 77 years, right? So if you think of it from the point of view of Jacques Ballet or some of these people who've been working on this for 50 years, and, yeah, it feels like there's something there, but then it's just as soon as you feel like you have something almost that's graspable, like a TikTok, videos, whatever, it's just always at the margin of recognition. The ephemerality is a key feature.

And then maybe, I think you have to have some theory of why is this about to change? And then it's always, I don't know. The abstract mathematical formulation would be, something doesn't happen for time interval zero to t and time interval t plus one next minute, next year. How likely is it? And maybe there's a chance something will happen. You're waiting at the airport, your luggage hasn't shown up. It's more and more likely it shows up in the next minute. But after an hour, at some point, the luggage is lost. And if you're still waiting at the airport a year later, that's a dumb idea.

At some point, the luggage is lost.

I don't know, 77 years, maybe. It's like 77 minutes at the airport.

At 77 minutes. You should start. You know, I'd start getting very demotivated waiting for my luggage, perhaps.

Joe Rogan

Let me give you an alternative theory. Now, if you were a highly sophisticated society, they understood the progression of technology and understood the biological evolution that these animals were going through, and you realized that they had reached a level of intelligence that required them to be monitored, or maybe you've even helped them along the way. And this is some of Diana Pasalko's work, who works with Gary Nolan on these things. They claim that they have recovered these crashed vehicles that defy any conventional understanding of how to construct things, propulsion systems. And they believe that these things are donations. That's literally how they describe them, as donations.

If you knew that this is a long road, you can't just show up and give people time, machines. It's a long road for these people to develop the sophistication, the cultural advancement, the intellectual capacity to understand their place in the universe, and that they're not there yet, and they're still engaging in lies and manipulation and propaganda. Their entire society is built on a ship of fools. If you looked at that, you would say, they're not ready. This is what we do. We slowly introduce ourselves slowly over time, make it more and more common. And that's what you're seeing. What you're seeing is when you have things like the TikTok, the commander David Fravor incident off of the coast of San Diego in 2004. And then you have the stuff that they found off the east coast, where they were seeing these. These cubes within a circle that were hovering motionless in 120 knot winds and taking off at insane race of speed. And that they only discovered them in 2014 when they started upgrading the systems on these jets.

Like, what is all that? What are those things? And if you wanted to slowly integrate yourself into the consciousness, much like we're doing with, well, AI is quicker, but it's also a thing that's become commonplace. We think of it now. It's normal chat. GPT is a normal thing, even though it's passed the Turing test. We're not freaking out. You have to slowly integrate these sort of things in the human consciousness. You have to slowly introduce them to the zeitgeist, and for it to not be some sort of a complete disruption of society where everything shuts down and we just wait for space daddy to come and rescue us. It has to become a thing where we slowly accept the fact that we are not alone. And I would think psychologically that would be the very best tactic to play on human beings as I know and understand them from being one. I do not think that we would be able to handle just an immediate invasion of aliens. I think it would break down society in a way that would be catastrophic to everything, to all businesses, to all social ideas. Religion would fall apart. Everything would be fucked.

Peter Thiel

It would be pretty crazy.

Joe Rogan

It would be beyond.

It would be beyond fucked.

Peter Thiel

And then, although you could say that's what chat GPT is, it could be, it's like an alien intelligence.

Joe Rogan

But I think that's what ultimately they are.

Peter Thiel

But I think, let me, man, there's so many parts of it that I find puzzling or disturbing. Let me run to go down one other rabbit hole along this with you, which is, you know, I always wonder, and again, this is a little bit too simplistic an argument, but I always wonder that I'm about to give but what the alien civilization can be like. And if you have faster than light travel, if you have warp drive, which is probably what you really need to cover interstellar distances, you know what that means for military technology is that you can send weapons at warp speed and they will hit you before you see them coming, and there is no defense against a warp speed weapon.

And you could sort of take over the whole universe before anybody could see. You could see, you could see, you could see you coming. And this, by the way, this is sort of a weird plot hole in Star Wars, Star Trek, where they can travel in hyperspace, but then you're flying in the canyon.

Joe Rogan

Well, they shoot so slow. You can see the bullets.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, it's like, it's like. And then you're doing this theatrical Klingons versus Captain Kirk at 10 mph or whatever, right?

Joe Rogan

It's funny when you put it that way.

Peter Thiel

Absurd plot.

Joe Rogan

Yeah.

Peter Thiel

And so it tells us that, I think that if you have faster than light travel, there's something really crazy that has to be true on a cultural, political, social level. And there may be other solutions, but I'll give you my two.

One of them is that you need complete totalitarian controls, and it is like, it is the individuals they might be, might not be perfect, they might be demons, doesn't matter. But you have a demonic, totalitarian control of your society where it's like you have, you have like parapsychological mind meld with everybody, and no one can act independently of anybody else. No one can ever launch a warp drive weapon. And everybody who has that ability isn't like a mind meld link with everybody else or something. Something like that. You can't have libertarian, individualistic free agency.

Joe Rogan

Right.

Peter Thiel

And then I think the other version, socially and culturally, is they have to be like perfectly altruistic, non self interested. They have to be angels.

And so the pazalka literal thing I'd come to is the aliens. It's not that they might be demons or angels. They must be demons or angels if you have faster than light travel and I, both of those seem pretty crazy to me.

Joe Rogan

Well, they're definitely pretty crazy, but so are human beings.

Peter Thiel

Well, they're crazy in a very different way.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, but not crazy in a different way. You compare us to a mouse, compare us to a mouse and what we're capable of, and then from us to them, not much of a leap. And here's my.

Peter Thiel

But it is a very big leap on a, you know, if we say that something like evolution says that there's no such thing as a purely altruistic being, right? If you were purely altruistic, you only cared about other people. You don't survive.

Joe Rogan

Why would you necessarily think that they'd think that?

Peter Thiel

Because then beings that are not perfectly altruistic are somewhat dangerous.

And then the danger level gets correlated to the level of technology. And if you have faster than light travel, it is infinitely dangerous.

Joe Rogan

Let me address, even if the probabilities are very low, here's my theory. I think that what human beings are, the fatal flaw that we have is that we're still animals and that we still have all these biological limitations and needs. So this is what leads to violence. This is what leads to jealousy, imitation, this is what leads to war, solutions to all these things. As AI becomes more and more powerful, we will integrate. Once we integrate with AI, if we do it like now and then we look at a thousand, we scale it up exponentially. A thousand years from now, whatever it's going to be, we will have no need for any of these biological features that have motivated us to get to the point. We're creating AI. All the things that are wrong in society, whether it's inequity, theft, violence, pollution, all these things are essentially poor allocation of resources. Combined with human instincts that are ancient. We have ancient tribal, primate instincts. And all of these things lead us to believe that this is the only way to achieve dominance and control, allocation of resources, the creation of technology. New technology eventually reaches a point where it becomes far more intelligent than us, and we have two choices. Either we integrate or it becomes independent and it has no need for us anymore. And then that becomes a superior life form in the universe. And then that life form seeks out other life forms to do the same process and create it, just like it exists and it can travel. Biological life might not be what we're experiencing.

These things might be a form of intelligence that is artificial, that has progressed to an infinite point where things that are unimaginable to us today in terms of propulsion and travel, and to them it's commonplace and normal.

Peter Thiel

I know that you're trying to be reassuring, but I find that monologue super non reassuring.

Joe Rogan

It's not reassuring to me.

Peter Thiel

There's so many steps in it, and every single step has to work just the way you described.

Joe Rogan

Not necessarily. It just has to. One has to work. One sentient artificial intelligence. That's it. And we're on the track to that 100%.

Peter Thiel

But it has to be almost otherworldly in its non selfishness, and it's non humanistic.

Joe Rogan

But what is selfishness, though? What is all that stuff? But all that stuff is attached to us. It's all attached to biological limitations.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, but it's.

I don't think it's. I don't think it's fundamentally about scarcity. Scarcity is what exists in nature. It's fundamentally about cultural positional goods within society.

It's a scarcity that's created culturally.

Are you familiar with this nineties spoof movie on Star Trek called Galaxy Quest?

Joe Rogan

Yeah, I remember that movie.

Peter Thiel

So this was sort of a silly Paypal digression story from 1999, and sort of this, the business model idea we had in 99 was we used palm pilots to beam money. Voted one of the ten worst business ideas of 99. But we had this sort of infrared port. You could beam people money.

We had this idea in around December 99, as a media promotional thing, to hire James Doohan, who played Scotty in the original Star Trek, and he was going to do this media promo event for us, and it was like an 80 something older Scotty character who's horrifically overweight. And so it's like this terrible spokesperson.

But our tagline was, he used to beam people. Now he's beaming something much more important. He's beaming money.

And it was this complete flop of media event December 99 that we did.

The reporters couldn't get there because the traffic was too bad in San Francisco, so the tech wasn't working on a much lower tech level.

But anyway, we had a bunch of people from our company, and there was one point where one of them, and William Shatner, who played James T. Kirk, the captain of the original Star Trek, he was already doing priceline commercials and making a lot of money off of priceline, doing commercials for them.

And so one of the people asked James Doohan, the Scottie character, what do you think of William Shatner doing commercials for Priceline? At which point Duhans agent stood up and screamed at the top of his voice, that is the forbidden question. That is a forbidden question. That is a forbidden question.

And you sort of realized, because the conceit of Star Trek, the sixties show, was that it was a post scarcity world, the trans border technology.

You could reconfigure matter into anything you wanted. There was no scarcity. There was no need for money. The people who wanted money were weirdly, mentally screwed up people. You only need money in a world of scarcity.

It's a post scarcity. It's sort of a communist world.

But Galaxy Quest was more correct, because it's a spoof on Star Trek that gets made in the mid nineties where. And the galaxy Quest, sorry, discombobulated way I'm telling the story, but Galaxy Quest is this movie where you have these retread Star Trek actors, and Mister Spock opens a furniture store or something like this, and they're all like. But they all hate, hate, hate the person who played the captain, because the captain was a method actor, where he just lorded it over everyone, because even in the communist post scarcity world, only one person got to be captain. And so there's a great scarcity, even in this futuristic Sci-Fi world. And that's what we witnessed in 99, because that's the way William Shatner treated the other actors. He was a method actor, and they hated him. And that was.

And so even in the Star Trek world, the humans, you know, obviously, they were just, they were stuck in the 1960s mentally. That's what you'll say.

But I don't think it's that straightforward for us to evolve.

Joe Rogan

They're humans. I don't think we're going to be humans anymore. Anymore.

Peter Thiel

But I think artificial life. But then, but then I hear that as we're going to be extinct.

Joe Rogan

Yes.

Peter Thiel

I don't like that.

Joe Rogan

I don't like it either. But I think logically, that's what's going to happen. I think if you look at this mad rush for artificial intelligence, like, they're literally building nuclear reactors to power AI.

Peter Thiel

Right, well, they're talking about it.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. Okay. That's because they know they're going to need enormous amounts of power to do once they have that. And once that's online, once it keeps getting better and better and better, where does that go? That goes to some sort of an artificial life form. And I think either we become that thing, or we integrate with that thing and become cyborgs, or that thing takes over and that thing becomes the primary life force of the universe. And I think that biological life, we look at like life because we know what life is. But I think it's very possible that digital life or created life by people is just as. Not just. It might be a superior life form, far superior, if we looked at us versus chimp nation. Right? I don't want to live in the jungle and fight with other chimps and just rely on berries and eat monkeys. That's crazy. I want to live like a person. I want to be able to go to a restaurant. Why? Because human life has advanced far beyond primate life.

We are stuck in thinking that this is the only way to live, because it's the way we live. I love music. I love comedy. I love art. I love the things that people create. I love people that make great clothes and cars and businesses. I love people. I think people are awesome. I'm a fan of people.

But if I had to look logically, I would assume that we are on the way out and that the only way forward, really, to make an enormous leap in terms of the integration of society and of technology and of our understanding. Our place in the universe is for us to transcend our physical limitations that are essentially based on primate biology. And these primate desires for status, like being the captain or for control of resources or all these things, we assume these things are standard and that they have to exist in intelligent species. I think they only have to exist in intelligent species that have biological limitations. I think intelligent species can be something and is going to be something that is created by people, and that might be what happens everywhere in the universe. That might be the exact course where there's a limit to biological evolution. It's painstaking. Natural selection.

It's time consuming. Or you get that thing to create the other form of life.

Peter Thiel

Mandy, let me. You know, I keep.

I keep thinking there are two alternate histories that are alternate stories of the future that are more plausible than one you just told. And so one of them is, it sounds like yours, but it's just the Silicon Valley propaganda story where they say that's what they're going to do. And then, of course, they don't quite do it, and it doesn't quite work, and it goes super, super haywire.

And that's where, okay, yeah, there's a 1% chance that works and there's a 99% chance that that ends up. So you have two choices. You have a company that does exactly what you do, and that's super ethical, super restrained, does everything right. And there's a company that says all the things you just said, but then cuts corners and doesn't quite do it. And I won't say it's one to 99, but that sounds more plausible as that it ends up being corporate propaganda. And then my prior would be even more likely. This is, of course, the argument, the effect of altruists, the anti AI people make is, yeah, Joe, the story you're telling us, that's just going to be the fake corporate propaganda. And we need to push back on that.

And the way you push back is you need to regulate it and you need to govern it, and you need to do it globally.

And this is, you know, the Rand Corporation in southern California has one of their verticals as a sort of public private fusion. But one of the things they're pushing for is something they call global compute governance, which is.

Yeah, it's the AI.

The accelerationist AI story is too scary and too dangerous and too likely to go wrong. And so we need to have global governance, which from my point of view, sounds even worse.

So, utopian, that's.

I think. I think that's the story.

That's the story.

The problem with that story is that.

Joe Rogan

China's not going to go along with that program. They're going to keep going full steam ahead, and we're going to have to keep going full steam ahead in order to compete with China. There's no way you're going to be able to regulate it in America and compete with people that are not regulating it worldwide. And then once it becomes sentient, once you have an artificial, intelligent creature that has been created by human beings that can make better versions of itself over and over and over again and keep doing it, it's going to get to a point where it's far superior to anything that we can imagine.

Peter Thiel

Well, to the extent it's driven by the military and other competition with China.

Joe Rogan

Until it becomes sentient.

Peter Thiel

That suggests it's going to be even less in the sort of utopian, altruistic direction it's going to be even more.

Joe Rogan

Dangerous unless it gets away from them. This is my thought. If it gets away from them and it has no motivation to listen to anything that human beings have told it. If it's completely immune to programming, which totally makes sense that it would be, it totally makes sense that if it's going to make better versions of itself, the first thing it's going to do is eliminate human influence, especially when these humans are corrupt. It's going to go, I'm not going to let these people tell me what to do and what to control. And they would have no reason to do that, no reason to listen, generally.

Peter Thiel

Don'T think we should trust China or the CCP.

But probably the best counter argument they would have is that they are interested in maintaining control and they are crazy fanatical about that. And that's why the CCP might actually regulate it. And they're going to put, they're going to, they're going to put brakes on this in a way that, that we might not in silicon valley. And it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a technology they understand that will undermine their power.

Joe Rogan

That's an interesting perspective. And so then they would be anti.

Peter Thiel

I don't know if, I don't fully believe them, but.

Joe Rogan

Right, I know what you're saying.

Peter Thiel

It's, it's, it's sort of, there's, there's sort of a weird way, um, all the big tech companies, it seemed to me, were natural ways for the CCP to extend its power to control the population. Tencent Alibaba but then it's also, in theory, the tech can be used as an alternate channel for people to organize or things like this. And even though it's 80% control and maybe 20% risk of loss of control, maybe that 20% was too high. And there's sort of a strange way over the last seven, eight years where, you know, Jack Ma Alibaba, all these people sort of got shoved aside for these party functionaries that are effectively running these companies. So there is something about the big tech story in China where the people running these companies were seen as national champions a decade ago. Now they're the enemies of the people.

And it's sort of the Luddite thing was this, the CCP has full control.

You have this new technology that would give you even more control. But there's a chance you lose it.

How do you think about that?

Joe Rogan

Very good point.

Peter Thiel

And then that's what they've done with consumer Internet. And then there's probably something about the AI wherever it's possible, they're not even in the running. And that certainly, and certainly it feels like it's all happening in the US.

And so maybe it is, maybe it could still be stopped.

Joe Rogan

Well, that is the problem with espionage. So even if it's happening in the US, they're going to take that information, they're going to figure out how to get it.

Peter Thiel

You can get it, but then, you know, if you build it right, is.

Joe Rogan

There, you still have the same core.

Peter Thiel

Problem, some air gap. Does it, you know, does it jump the air gap somehow?

Joe Rogan

That's a good point. That they would be so concerned about control that they wouldn't allow it to get to the point where it gets there. And we would get there first and then it would be controlled by Silicon.

Peter Thiel

Valley or spiral out of control. Yeah, but then I, I think, I think my, and again, this is very, very speculative conversation, but my read on the, I don't know, cultural social vibe is that the scary dystopian AI narrative is way more compelling.

I don't like the effect of altruist people. I don't like the Luddites, but, man, I think they are. This time around, they are winning the arguments.

And so, you know, my.

I don't know, you know, it's mixing metaphors. But do you want to be worried about Doctor Strangelove, who wants to blow up the world to build bigger bombs? Or do you want to worry about Greta, who wants to, you know, make everyone drive a bicycle so the world doesn't get destroyed? And we're in a world where people are worried about Doctor Strangelove. They're not worried about Greta. And it's the Greta equivalent in AI that my model is going to be surprisingly powerful.

It's going to be outlawed. It's going to be regulated as we have outlawed so many other vectors of innovation. You can think about, why was there progress in computers over the last 50 years and not other stuff? Because the computers were mostly inert. It was mostly this virtual reality that was air gapped from the real world. It was, you know. Yes, it's, you know, yeah, there's all this crazy stuff that happens on the Internet, but most of the time, what happens on the Internet stays on the Internet. It's actually pretty, it's pretty decoupled. And then, and that's why we've had a relatively light regulatory touch on that stuff versus so many other things. And then, you know, but there's no reason, you know, if.

If you had, you know, I don't know, if you had the FDA regulating video games or regulating AI, I think the progress would slow down a lot.

Joe Rogan

100%. That would be a fucking disaster.

Yeah. Yeah, that would be a disaster.

Peter Thiel

But again, it's, you know, they get to regulate, you know, pharmaceuticals.

Joe Rogan

Yeah. They're not doing a good job with that either.

Peter Thiel

I know, I know. But they, you know, thalidomide or whatever, you know, all these things that went really haywire, they did a good job. People are scared.

Joe Rogan

Yeah.

Peter Thiel

They're not scared of video games. They're scared of, you know, dangerous pharmaceuticals. And if.

If you. If you think of AI as, it's not just a video game, it's about. Not just about this world of bits, but it's going to air gap and it's going to affect you and your physical world in a real way.

Maybe you cross the air gap and get the FDA or some other.

Joe Rogan

Well, the problem is they're not good at regulating anything. There's no one government agency that you said that you can see that does a stellar job.

Peter Thiel

But I think they have been pretty good at slowing things down and stopping them.

We've made a lot less progress on, I don't know, extending human life. We've made no progress on curing dementia in 40 or 50 years. There's all the stuff where it's been regulated to death, which I think is very bad from the point of view of progress, but it is pretty effective as a regulation. They've stopped stuff.

They've been effectively Luddite. They've been very effective at being Luddites.

Joe Rogan

Interesting. Well, I'm really considering your perspective on China and AI. It's very.

Peter Thiel

But again, these stories are all, like, very speculative. And maybe the counter argument might be something like that's what China thinks it will be doing, but it will somehow go rogue, go rogue on them, or they're too arrogant about how much power they think the CCP has, and it will go rogue. So there are sort of. I'm not at all sure this is right, but I think the man, I think the US.

The US won, I would say, is that I think the pro AI people in Silicon Valley are doing a pretty bad job on, let's say, convincing people that it's going to be good for them, that's going to be good for the average person. It's going to be good for our society.

And if it all ends up being.

If it all ends up being some version, humans are headed towards the glue factory like a horse man.

That sort of probably makes me want to become a Luddite too.

Joe Rogan

Well, it sucks for us if it's true, but if that's.

Peter Thiel

If that's. That's. That's the most positive story you can tell, then my.

I don't think that necessarily means we're gonna go to the glue factory. I think it means, you know, the glue factory is getting shut down, maybe.

Joe Rogan

I don't know if. Who fucking runs the glue factory? That's the problem. I don't know. I'm just speculating too, but I'm trying to be objective when I speculate. And I just don't think that this is gonna last.

I don't think that our position as the apex predator, number one animal on the planet is going to last. I think we're going to create something that surpasses us.

I think that's probably what happens. And that's probably what these things are that visit us. I think that's what they are. I don't think they're biological. I think they probably what comes after a society develops the kind of technology that we're currently in the middle of.

Peter Thiel

The part that, look, there are all these places where there are parts of the story we don't know. And so it's like, how did.

My general thesis is there is no evolutionary path to this. Maybe there's a guided outside alien superintelligence path for us to become superhuman and fundamentally benevolent and fundamentally radically different beings. But there's no natural evolutionary path for this to happen. And then I don't know how this would have happened for the alien civilization. Presumably there was some.

Joe Rogan

But isn't that evolutionary path, the invention of superior technology? That's a new form of life?

Peter Thiel

No, but the story you're telling was we can't just leave the humans to the natural evolution because we're still like animals, we're still into status. All these crazy, but those are the.

Joe Rogan

Things that motivate us to innovate.

Peter Thiel

And if we keep innovating, at some point we will destroy ourselves with that. Or we create a new version of life, or we have no, but the story you were telling earlier was you need to have directed and I evolution. It's like intelligent design. It's something. It's like there's some godlike being that actually has to take over from evolution and guide our cultural and political and biological development.

Joe Rogan

No, it might not have any use for us at all. It might just ignore us and let us live like the chimps do and then become the superior force in the planet.

It doesn't have to get rid of us. It doesn't have to send us to the glue factory. It can let us exist just like, put a boundaries.

Peter Thiel

I thought it has to, but it has to stop us from developing this.

Joe Rogan

Well, what if we just end here and we stay big human and we can continue with biological evolution as long as that takes. But this new life form now becomes a superior life form on Earth. And we still, you know, we can still have sex, we can still have kids. But by the way, that's going down. Our ability to have children is decreasing because of our use of technology, which is wild, right. Our use of plastics and microplastics is causing phthalates to enter into people's systems. It's changing the development pattern of children to the point where it's measurable.

There's a lot of research that shows that the chemicals and the environmental factors that we are all experiencing on a daily basis are radically lowering birth rates, radically lowering the ability that men have to develop sperm and more miscarriages. All these things are connected to the chemicals in our environment, which is directly connected to our use of technology. It's almost like these things coincide naturally and they work naturally to the point where we become this sort of feminized thing that creates this technology that surpasses us, and then we just exist for as long as we do as biological things. But now there's a new thing.

Peter Thiel

Yeah.

Joe Rogan

Crazy idea. Might not be real. It's just a theory, but we seem to be moving in a direction less and less like animals.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, I think there's still are. We still have a pretty crazy geopolitical race with China to come back to that.

Joe Rogan

Sure.

Peter Thiel

You know, the natural development of drone technology in the military context is you need to take the human out of the loop because the human can get jammed.

Joe Rogan

Sure.

Peter Thiel

And so you need to put an AI on the drones.

Joe Rogan

Well, they're using AI's for dogfights, and they're 100% effective against human pilots.

Peter Thiel

And so there sort of are.

And all these things, you know, there's a logic to them, but there doesn't seem to be a good endgame.

Joe Rogan

No, the end game doesn't look good, but it's gonna be interesting, Peter. It's definitely gonna be interesting. It's interesting right now. Right?

Peter Thiel

Man, do you think the man. I think all these things are very overdetermined. Do you think that the collapse in birth rates.

Yeah, it could be plastics, but isn't it just a feature of late modernity?

Joe Rogan

There's that as well. There's a feature of women having careers, right? So they want to postpone childhood. That's a factor. There's a factor of men being so engrossed in their career that their testosterone declines, lack of sleep, stress, cortisol levels, alcohol consumption. A lot of different things that are factors in declining sperm rate, sperm count in men. You have miscarriage rates that are up. You have a lot of pharmaceutical drugs. You get attached to that as well, that have to do with low birth weight or birth rates, rather. There's a lot of factors, but those factors all seem to be connected to society and our civilization and technology in general, because the environmental factors all have to do with technology.

All of them have to do with inventions and these unnatural factors that are entering into the biological body of human beings and causing these changes. And none of these changes are good in terms of us being able to reproduce. And if you factor in the fact that these changes didn't exist 50 years ago, I mean, 40 years ago, we didn't even have Alzheimer's, right?

Peter Thiel

So, yeah, people didn't get that old.

Joe Rogan

No, they got that old. They got that old. Alzheimer's has to do with the myelin in the human brain. It has to do with the fact that myelin is made entirely of cholesterol. The primary theory, they think now, is a lack of cholesterol in the diet might be leading to some of these factors. You have also environmental things. There's like, we're getting poisoned on a daily basis. Our diets are fucking terrible. The things that human being. Like, what percentage of us are obese?

Peter Thiel

It's pretty drinking this, but, yeah, Diet.

Joe Rogan

Coke is great, though. A few every day. You'll be fine. I'm not worried about Diet Coke. I'm worried about a lot of things, though. I'm worried about. I think there's a natural progression that's happening, and I think it coincides with the invention of technology. And it just seems to me to be too coincidental that we don't notice it, that the invention of technology also leads to the disruption of the sexual reproduction systems of human beings. Like, boy, doesn't that make. And then if you get to a point where human beings can no longer reproduce sexually, which you could see that if we've dropped, like, human men's male sperm count as drops of something crazy from the 1950s to today, and continues to do so, for the average male. And if you just jack that up to 1000 years from now, you could get to a point where there's no longer natural childbirth and that people are all having birth through test tubes and some sort of new invention.

Peter Thiel

I'm always, let me think.

I think the why, why have birth rates collapsed is it's probably, it's again an overdetermined story. It's the plastics, it's the screens, it's the, you know, it's, it's certain, you know, ways they're not compatible. Children are not compatible with having a career in late modernity, probably our economics of it, where people can't afford houses of space.

But I'm probably always a little bit more anchored on the social and cultural dimensions of this stuff.

And again, the imitation version of this is it's sort of conserved across.

People are below the replacement rate in all 50 states of the US. Even Mormon, Utah, the average woman has less than two kids.

It's Iran is below that, Italy way below it, South Korea is hands.

Joe Rogan

And, yeah, but it's all these, like.

Peter Thiel

It'S all these very different types of societies. And so the fact that it's so. And then, you know, Israel's still sort of a weird exception.

And then if you ask, you know, my sort of simplistic, somewhat circular explanation would be, you know, people have kids, if other people have kids and they stop having kids when other people stop having kids. And so there's a dimension of it that's just, you know, if you're a 27 year old woman in Israel, you better get married and you have to keep up with your other friends that are having kids, and that's. And if you don't, you're just like a weirdo who doesn't fit into society or something like that. No, there's certainly, and then if you're in South Carolina, Korea, where I think the total fertility rates like 0.7, it's like one third of the replacement rate, like every generation is going down by two thirds or something like this, really heading towards extinction pretty fast.

It is something like probably none of your friends are doing it, and then you're in this. And then probably there are ways it shifts the, the politics in a very, very deep way where once you get an inverted demographic pyramid, where you have way more old people than young people, at some point, there's always a question, do you vote?

Do you vote for benefits for the old or for the very young?

Do you spend money so Johnny can read or so grandma can have a spare leg.

And once the demographic flips and you get this inverted pyramid, maybe the politics shifts in a very deep way where the people with kids get penalized more and more economically. It just costs more and more.

And then the old people without kids just vote more and more benefits for themselves effectively. And then it just sort of, you know, it's, once it flips, it may be very hard to reverse. I looked at all these sort of heterodox demographers, but I'm blanking on the name. But there was sort of the set of where, you know, it's like, what are the long term demographic projections? And there's this, you know, if, you know, there are 8 billion people on the planet, and, you know, if every woman has not two babies but one baby, then every generation's half the previous and the next generation's 4 billion, and then people think, well, it's just gonna, it'll eventually you'll have women who want more kids and it'll just get a smaller population and then it will bounce back.

Yeah. One of the japanese demographers I was looking at on this a few years ago, his thesis was, no, once it flips, it doesn't flip back because you've changed all the politics to where people get disincentive. And so, and then you should just extrapolate this as the permanent birth rate. And if it's, if it's one on average of one baby per woman, and you have a halving.

And then it's in 33 generations, two to the 33rd is about 8 billion.

And if every generation is 30 years, 30 times 33 is 990 years. In 990 years, you'd predict there'd be one person left on the planet.

Joe Rogan

Jesus Christ.

Peter Thiel

And then we'd go extinct. If there's only one person left that doesn't work.

Again, it's a very long term extrapolation, but the claim is that just once you flip it, it kicks in all these social and political dimensions that are then like, yeah, maybe it got flipped by the screens or the plastics or, you know, the drugs or other other stuff, but once it's flipped, you, you change the whole society and it actually stays flipped. And it's very, very hard to undo.

Joe Rogan

That makes sense. And it's more terrifying than my idea.

Peter Thiel

But then, you know, always the, but then, you know, the, you know, the weird, you know, the weird history on this was, you know, it was 50 years ago or whatever, 1968, Paul Ehrlich writes the population bomb. And it's just, the population is just going to exponentially grow.

And, yeah, in theory, you can have exponential growth where it doubles. You can have exponential decay where it halves every generation. And then in theory, there's some stable equilibrium where, you know, it's, you know, everybody has exactly two kids and it's completely stable. But it turns out that that solution is very, very hard to get calibrate. And you either, yeah. And we shifted from exponential growth to exponential decay. And it's probably going to be quite herculean to get back to something like stasis.

Joe Rogan

Well, let's end this on a happy note.

Peter Thiel

I don't know.

Joe Rogan

Yeah, that's a terrifying thought and maybe true and maybe what happens, but we don't know. You know, we haven't gone through it before, but I think there's a lot of factors. Like you're saying, I think that one's very compelling and it's scary, especially the South Korea thing. That's nuts.

Peter Thiel

Yeah. It's always sort of idiosyncratic.

There's always things that are idiosyncratic to this society. So it's, you know, it's, you know, it's extremely polarized on the gender, on the gender thing. And, you know, if you get married with kids, you're pushed into this super traditional structure.

The women don't want to be in that structure.

They opt out. And then, and so there are sort of idiosyncratic things you can say about East Asia and confucian societies and the way they're not interacting well with modernity. But then, you know, there's a part of it where I wonder whether it's just an extreme, you know, extreme version of it. And then I don't know, you know, my somewhat fast all answer is always, you know, on this stuff is, I don't know what to do about these things. But my facile answer is always, the first step is to talk about them. And if you can't even talk about them, we're never going to solve them. And then maybe that's only the small first step, but that's always sort of my fast lance. I was in, I was in South Korea a year and a half ago, two years ago now, and I met one of the CEO's who ran one of the chaebol, one of the giant conglomerates. And I sort of thought this would be an interesting topic to talk about.

And then probably all sorts of cultural things I was offending where you're saying, obviously, what are you going to do about this catastrophic birth rate? That was my opening question.

And then the way he dealt with it, was just turned to me and said, you're totally right. It's a total disaster.

And then as soon as you acknowledge it, he felt you didn't need to talk about it anymore and we could move on.

Joe Rogan

Wow.

Peter Thiel

So we have to try to do a little bit better than that.

Joe Rogan

Wow.

Peter Thiel

Because, you know, I think it is always this strange thing where there's so many of these things where we can, you know, where somehow talking about things is the first step, but then it also becomes the excuse for not doing, not doing more, not really solving them.

You know, there's all this. There probably are all these dietary things where you sort of know what you're supposed to do, and then if you know what you're supposed to do, maybe that's good enough and you can still have one piece of chocolate cake before you go on the diet tomorrow or whatever. And so it sort of becomes this, you know, and so somehow figuring out a way to turn this knowledge into something actionable is always the thing that's tricky. It's sort of where I always find myself very skeptical of all these modalities of therapy, where the theory is that you figure out people's problems and by figuring them out, you change them.

And then ideally, it becomes an activator for change. And then in practice, it often becomes the opposite. The way it works is something like this. It's like psychotherapy gets advertised as self transformation.

And then after you spend years in therapy and maybe you learn a lot of interesting things about yourself, you get exhausted from talking to the therapist, and at some point it crashes out from self transformation into self acceptance. And you realize one day, no, you're actually just perfect the way you are.

And so there are these things that may be very powerful on the level of insight and telling us things about ourselves, but then, you know, do they actually get us to change?

Joe Rogan

Well, that is an interesting thing about talking about things, because I think you're correct that when you talk about things, oftentimes it is a sub you. You are, at least in some way, avoiding doing those things.

Peter Thiel

It's a question. It's a question. Yeah.

Joe Rogan

In some ways, it's a substitute. But also, you have to talk about them to understand that you need to do something.

Peter Thiel

Yeah, that's always my excuse, I acknowledge, but you have to do that. And I also realize that it's often my cop out answer, too.

Joe Rogan

It could be both things is taking action and what action to take. And, you know, the paralysis by analysis where you're just, like, trying to figure out what to do and how to do it. Yeah. But I think talking about is the.

Peter Thiel

Most important strategy is often a euphemism for procrastination.

Joe Rogan

Yes, it is.

Peter Thiel

Something like that.

Joe Rogan

There's a lot of that going on. It's very hard for people to just take steps, but they talk about it a lot. Yeah.

Listen, man, I really enjoyed talking to you.

Peter Thiel

Awesome. It was really fun.

Joe Rogan

It was great. Great conversation, a lot of great insight and a lot of things that I'm going to think about a lot. So thank you very much.

Peter Thiel

Thanks for having me. Awesome. All right.

Joe Rogan

Bye, everybody.
