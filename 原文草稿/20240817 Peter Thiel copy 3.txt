we do we have a [ __ ] Rover running around on Mars right now collecting data do we send the James web telescope into

space of course we do we have a lot of stuff that we send into space if we lived another million years without blowing ourselves up which is just a

blink of an eye in terms of the life of some of the planets in the universe how how much more advanced would we be

and if we were Interstellar and if we were Intergalactic Travelers and we found out that there was a primitive

species that was coming of age I think we would start visiting them you know the let me think what

my I hear everything you're saying I'm I'm I'm strangely under motivated by it

even if even if it's plausible too believe it or not

um and I guess I guess on the space Al which is the the Wilder more interesting

one in a way you know I don't know

Roswell was 77 years ago

1947 and if um if

um if the phenomenon is real and it's it's from another world it's space

aliens space robots what whatever

um you know probably one of the key features is its ephemerality or its

cloaking and they are really good at hiding it at cloaking it at um

scrambling people's brains after they see them or or stuff like this right and then um you know if you're a researcher

you you have to pick Fields where you can make progress and so um this is um

you know it's not a promising field in you know I know Academia is messed up but even if Academia were not messed up

this would not be a good field in which to try to make a career because there's been so little PR R in 77 years and

so you think of it from the point of view of I know jacqu valet or you know

some of these people have been working on this for 50 years and um yeah it's it feels like there's something there and

um but then it's it's just as soon as you as soon as you feel like you have

something almost that's graspable like a Tik Tok videos whatever it just it's it's just always at the margin of

recognition and it's the ephemerality is a is a key feature and um and then um you know maybe you have to then you have

to I think you have to have some theory of you know why is this about to change and then it's always you know I

don't know the abstract mathematical formulation would be you know um

something um doesn't happen for time interval 0er to T and time interval t+

one next minute next year How likely is it and maybe maybe there's a chance something will will happen you're

waiting at the airport your luggage hasn't shown up it's more and more likely it shows up in the next minute

but after an hour you know at some point the luggage is lost and if you're still waiting at the airport a year later

that's a dumb idea at some point at some point the luggage is lost right and like

you know it's I don't know 77 years it's like maybe it's like 77 minutes at the

airport that's at 77 minutes you should stop you know I I'd start getting very demotivated waiting for my luggage

perhaps let me Al give you an alter alternative Theory now if you were a a highly sophisticated Society they

understood the progression of technology and understood the uh biological evolution that these animals were going

through and you realized that they had reached uh a level of intelligence that required them to be monitored or maybe

you even helped them along the way and this is uh some of Diana P's work who uh

uh works with uh with Gary Nolan on these things they they claim that they have recovered these crashed

vehicles that defy any conventional understanding of

how to construct things uh propulsion systems and they believe that these things are donations that's literally

how they describe them as donations if you knew that this is a long road this

is you can't just show up and give people time machines it's a long road

for these people to develop the sophistication the cultural advancement the uh intellectual capacity to

understand their place in the universe and that they're not there yet and they're still engaging in lies and

manipulation and propaganda their entire Society is built on a Ship of Fools if

you looked at that you would say they're not ready this is what we do we slowly

introduce ourselves slowly over time make it more and more common and that's

what you're seeing what you're seeing is when you have things like the tick talk uh the commander David fraver um

incident off of the coast of San Diego in 2004 and then you have the the stuff

that they found off the east coast where they were seeing these these uh cubes

within a circle that were hovering motionless and 120 knot winds and taking off an insane race of speed and that

they only discovered them in 2014 when they started upgrading the systems on these Jets like what is all that like

what are those things and if you if wanted to slowly integrate yourself into the Consciousness much like we're doing

with well AI is quicker right but it's also a thing that's become commonplace we think of it now it's normal chat GPT

is a normal thing even though it's past the Turing test we're not freaking out you have to slowly integrate these sort of things in the human consciousness you

have to slowly introduce them to the Zeitgeist and for it to not be some sort of a complete disruption of society

where everything shuts down and we just wait for space Daddy to come and rescue us it has to become a thing where we

slowly accept the fact that we are not alone and I would think psychologically that would be the very best tactic to

play on human beings as I know and understand them from being from being one I do not think that we would be able

to handle just an immediate invasion of aliens I think it would break down

Society in a way that would be catastrophic to everything to all businesses to all social ideas Rel

religion would fall apart everything would be [ __ ] it would be pretty crazy it would be beyond crazy it would be Beyond [ __ ] and then alth although you

could say you could say that's what chat GPT is it could be it's like an alien

intelligence but I think that's what

ultimately they are um but I think

um let me man there there's so many

there's so many parts of it that uh I find puzzling or or disturbing let me

let me run one go down one other Rabbit Hole along this with you which is um you know I always

wonder and again this is a little bit too simplistic an argument but uh I

always wonder I'm about to give but what

what the alien civilization can be like and if you have faster than light travel

if you have a warp drive which is probably what you really need to cover Interstellar

distances um you know what that means for military technology is that you can send weapons

at warp speed and they will hit you before you see them coming and uh there

is no defense against a warp speed weapon um and you could sort of take

over the whole universe before anybody could see you um could see could see you

uh could see you um could see you coming and this is by by the way this is sort

of a weird plot hole in Star wars Star Trek where they can travel in hyperspace

but then you're you know flying in the canyon on so slow you can see the bullets yeah it's like it's like at

you're and then you're doing this theatrical Klingons versus uh Captain Kirk at 10 miles per hour or 20 miles per hour or whatever right it's funny

when you put it that way absurd plot

hole and um and so um it it it tells us

that uh I think that if you have if you

have um faster than light travel there's something um really crazy that

has to be true on a cultural political social level and there may be other

Solutions but I'll give you my two um

one of one of them is that um you need

complete totalitarian

controls and it is like it

is the PE the individuals they might be might not be perfect they might be

demons doesn't matter but you have you have a demonic totalitarian control of

your Society where it's like you have you have like Paras psychological mind

meld with everybody and no one can act independently of anybody else no one can

ever launch a warp drive weapon and everybody who has that ability isn't

like a m mind meld link with everybody else or or something something like that

you can't have libertar individualistic free agency right and

then I think the other the other version

socially and culturally

is they have to be like perfectly

altruistic non- self-interest they have to be angels and so the Pula literal

thing I'd come to is the aliens it's not that they might be demons or Angels they

must be demons or Angels if you have faster than travel and both of those seem pretty crazy to me well they're

definitely pretty crazy but so are human beings um well they're crazy in a very different way yeah but not crazy in a

different way you compare us to a mouse compare us to a mouse and what we're capable of and then from us to them not

much of a leap and here's my here's my question all but but it is it it is a

very big leap on a you know if we if we say that something like Evolution says

that there's no such thing as a purely altruistic being right if if you were purely altruistic if you only cared

about other people you don't survive well but why would you necessarily think

that they'd think that um BEC because uh because because then um you beings that

are not perfectly altruistic are somewhat dangerous let me let me and then you and then and then the danger

level gets correlated to the level of technology and if you have faster than light travel it is infinitely dangerous

let me address that if the probabilities are very low here's my theory I think that what human beings are the the Fatal

flaw that we have is that we're still animals and that we still have all these biological limitations and needs this is

what leads to violence this is what leads to jealousy imitation this is what

leads to war this what leads to all these things as AI becomes more and more

powerful we will integrate once we integrate with AI if we do it like now and then we look at a thousand we scale

it up exponentially a thousand years from now whatever it's going to be we will have no need for any of these biological features that have motivated

us to get to the point where we're creating AI all the things that are

wrong in society whether it's inequity theft violence pollution all these

things are essentially poor allocation of resources combined with human

instinct that are ancient we have ancient tribal primate instincts and all

of these things lead us to believe that this is the only way to achieve

dominance and control allocation of resources the creation of Technology new

technology eventually reaches a point where it becomes far more intelligent

than us and we have two choices either we integrate or it becomes independent

and it has no need for us anymore and then that becomes a superior life form in the universe and then that life form

seeks out other life forms to do the same process and create it just like it

exists and it can travel biological life might not be what we're experiencing

these things might be a form of intelligence that is artificial that has

progressed to an an infinite point where things that are unimaginable us to to us today in terms of propulsion and travel

and to them it's common place and normal I I know that that you're you're trying to be reassuring but I I just I find that

monologue super non-reassuring it's not reassuring there's so many steps in it and every single step has to work just

the way you describe not necessarily it just has to one has to work one sensient artificial intelligence that's it and

we're on the track to that 100% but it has it it it it has it has to it has to

be almost otherworldly in it's um and it's non- selfishness and it's non-h

humanness what is selfishness though what is all that stuff but all that stuff is attached to us it's all attached to biological limitations yeah but it's I I don't I don't think I don't

think it's um I don't think it's fundamentally about scarcity scarcity is what exists in nature it's it's

fundamentally about um cultural positional Goods within

Society it's a scarcity that's created culturally are are you familiar with um

this um '90s spoof movie on Star Trek called Galaxy Quest yeah I remember that

movie um so this was uh I this is sort of a silly PayPal digression story from

1999 um and we we had sort of this business model idea we had in 99 was we're going to use Palm Pilots to

beam money was voted one of the 10 worst business ideas of 99 but we uh um we

have this sort of infrared Port you could um beam people money and we had

this um idea in around December 99 as a

media a promotional thing to hire um James Doan who played Scotty the um in

the original Star Trek and he was going to do this media promo event for us and

it was like an 80-some um older Scotty character who's horrifically overweight and so it's like

this terrible spokesperson um and uh but our tagline was you know he used to beam people now he's beaming something much more

important he's beaming money and um and it was this complete flop of media event

December 99 that uh we did um it was some the reporters couldn't get there because the traffic was too bad in San

Francisco so that you know the tech wasn't working on a much lower tech level but uh but anyway we had a bunch

of people from our company and there was

one point where one of them um um um and

um um William Shatner who played um uh James Kirk the captain of the original

Star Trek he was already doing uh Price Line commercials and making a lot of money off of Price Line doing doing commercials for them and uh and so one

of the people asked James Doan the Scotty character what do you

think of uh William Shatner uh doing commercials for Price Line at which

point Doan's agent stood up and screamed at the top of his voice that is the

forbidden question that is a forbidden question that is a forbidden question and you sort of

realized because you know the the con the conceit of Star Trek the 60s show

was that it was a post scarcity World The Transporter technology you could you could reconfigure matter into anything

you wanted uh there was no scarcity there was no need for money the people who wanted money were weirdly mentally

screwed up people you only need money in a world of scarcity you know it's it's it's a post scarcity it's sort of a

communist world but um but uh Galaxy Quest was more correct because it's it's a spoof on

Star Trek that gets made in the mid 90s where um and the Galaxy Quest s discombobulated way I'm telling the

story but Galaxy Quest is this is this movie where you have these retread Star Trek actors and Mr Spock opens a

furniture store or something like this and they're all like but they all hate hate hate the person who played the

captain because the captain was a method actor where he just lorded it over

everyone because even in the Communist post scarcity world only one person got

to be captain and um and so there's a great scarcity even in this futuristic

sci-fi world and that's what we witnessed in 99 because that's the way uh William Shatner treated the other

actors he was a method actor and they hated him and that was uh and uh and so

um even in the Star Trek world the humans you know obviously they were just they were stuck in the 1960s mentally

that's what you'll say but uh but um I don't I don't think it's that straightforward for us to evolve they're

humans I don't think we're going to be humans anymore but uh I think artificial life but then but then I hear that is

we're going to be extinct yes I don't like that I don't like it either but I

think logically that's what's going to happen I think if you look at this mad rush for artificial intelligence like

they're they're literally building nuclear reactors to power AI right well they're talking about it yeah okay that's because they know

they're going to need enormous amounts of power to do the once they have that and once that's online once it keeps getting better and better and better

where does that go that goes to some sort of an artificial life form and I think either we become that thing or we

integrate with that thing and become cyborgs or that thing takes over and that thing becomes the primary life

force of the universe and I think that biological life we look at like life because we know what life is but I think

it's very possible the Digital Life or created Life by people is just as not

just it might be a superior life form far superior if we looked at US versus

chimp Nation right I don't want to live in the jungle and fight with other chimps and just rely on berries and

eating monkeys that's crazy I want to live like a person I want to be able to go to a restaurant why because human

life has advanced far beyond Prime life we are stuck in thinking that this is

the only way to live because it's the way we live I love music I love comedy I love art I love the things that people

create I love people that make great clothes and cars and businesses I love people I think people are awesome I'm a

fan of people but if I had to look logically I would I would assume that we

are on the way out and that the only way

forward really to make an enormous leap

in terms of the integration of society and of technology and of our

understanding our place in the universe is for us to transcend our physical limitations that are essentially based

on primate biology and these primate desires for status like being the

captain or for control of resources of all these things we assume these things

are standard and that they have to exist in intelligent species I think they only have to exist in intelligent species

that have biological limitations I think intelligent species can be something and is going to be something that is created

by people and that might be what happens everywhere in the universe that might be

the exact course where there's a limit to biological evolution it's painstaking

natural selection it's it's time consuming or you get that thing to

create the other form of life man I um let me you know I

keep I keep thinking there are two alternate histories that are alternate stories of the future that are more

plausible than the one you just told and um so one of them is it sounds like

yours but it's just the Silicon Valley propaganda story where where they say that's what they're going to do and then

of course they don't quite do it and it doesn't quite work and um it goes It

goes super super haywire and um and

that's uh and that's where okay yeah there's a one% chance that works and um

there's a 99% chance that um that ends up so you have two choices you have a

company that does exactly what you do and that's super ethical super restrained does everything right and

there's a company that says all the things you just said but then Cuts corners and doesn't quite do it and I

won't say it's 1 to 99 but that that sounds more plausible as that it ends up

being corporate propaganda and then um you know my prior would be even more likely this of course the argument the

effective altruist the anti- AI people make is yeah Joe you're um the story you're telling us that's just going to

be the fake corporate propaganda and um and we need to push back on that and um

and the way you push back is you need to regulate it and you need to govern it

and you need to do it globally um and this is you know um the Rand Corporation

in Southern California uh has you know one one of their verticals and it's a sort of public private Fusion but one of

the things they they they're pushing for is something they call Global compute

governance which is um yeah it's uh the AI the the the accelerationist AI story

is too scary and too dangerous and too likely to go wrong and so

um you know we need to have uh you know Global governance which from my point of

view sounds even worse but so utopian but that's that's uh that's I think I

think that's the story that's the story uh the problem with that story is China is not going to go along with that program they're going to keep going full

steam ahead and we're going to have to go keep going full steam ahead in order to compete with China there's no way you're going to be able to regulate It

in America and compete with people that are not regulating worldwide and then once it becomes sentient once you have

an artificial intelligent creature that has been created by human beings it can make better versions of itself over and over and over again and keep doing it

it's going to get to a point where it's far superior to anything that we can imagine well well to the to the extent

it's driven by the military and other competition with China um you know that's until it becomes sensient that

that that that suggests it's going to be even less in in the sort of um you know

utopian altruistic uh dire it's going be even more dangerous right unless it gets away from them this is my thought if it

gets away from them and it has no motivation to listen to anything that human beings have told it if it's completely immune to programming which

totally makes sense that it would be it totally makes sense that if it's going to make better versions of itself the first thing it's going to do is eliminate human influence especially when these humans are corrupt it's going

to go I'm not going to let these people tell me what to do and what to control and they would have no no reason to do that no reason listen I I sort of

generally don't think we should trust China or the CCP but but the you know

probably the count the best counter argument they would have is that they

are interested in maintaining control

and they are crazy fanatical about that and that's why um you know the CCP might

actually regulate it and they're going to put they're going to they're going to put breaks on this in a way that uh that

we might not in in in Silicon Valley and and it's it's it's it's a it's a technology they understand that will

undermine their power that's an interesting perspective and then they would be anti comp I don't fully believe

them but right I I know what you're saying it's it's it's sort of uh there

there's sort of a weird way um all the big tech

companies it seemed to me where natural ways for the CCP to extend its power to

control the population 10cent Alibaba and then um and then because it was it

was you know but then it's also in theory the tech is can be used as an

alternate channel for people to organize or or or or things like this and uh even

though it's 80% control and maybe 20%

risk of loss of control um maybe that 20% was too high and there's sort of a

strange way over the last seven eight years where you know Jack M Alibaba all these people sort of got uh got shoved

aside for uh these party functionaries that are effectively running these companies so there there is something

about um the the big Tech story in China where uh the people running these companies were seen as national

champions a decade ago now they're the

enemies of the people and uh it's sort

of the Lite thing was this uh you know this the CCP has full control you have

this new technology that would give you even more control but there's a chance you lose it how how do you think about that very good point and then that's

what they've done with consumer internet and then there's probably something about the AI where M it's possible

they're they're not even in the running and that c certainly um and certainly it feels like it's it's all happening you

know in in the US and so may maybe it is you know maybe

it could still be maybe it could still be be stopped and then well that is a problem with Espionage right so even if it's happening in the USU they're going

to take that information they're going to figure out how to get it you you can get it but then you know if if you if you build it is there you still have the

same core problem some air gap does it you know does it jump the air gap does it somehow that's a good point that they would be so concerned about control that they wouldn't allow it to get to the

point where it gets there and we would get there first and then it would be controlled by Silicone Valley

or spiral out of control but then I I

think I think my and again this is very very speculative conversation but my um

my read on the I don't know cultural

social Vibe is that uh um the scary

dystopian AI narrative is way more compelling you know the I don't like the effective altruist people I don't like

the Lites but man I think are this time around they are winning the

arguments and um and so you know my I don't know you know it's it's

mixing metaphors but do you want to be worried about Doctor Strange Love who wants to blow up the world to build

bigger bombs or do you want to worry about Greta who wants to you know make everyone drive a bicycle so the world

doesn't get destroyed and um we're in a world where people are worried about Doctor Strange Love they're not worried

about Gret and it's the Greta equivalent in um in

AI that that uh my model is is is going to be surprisingly powerful it's going

to be outlawed it's going to be regulated as we have outlawed you know so many other vectors of innovation I

mean you can think about why was there progress in computers over the last 50 years and not other stuff because the

computers were mostly inert it was mostly this virtual reality that was air

gapped from The Real World it was you know yeah it's it's um what you know yeah there's all this crazy stuff that

happens on the internet but most of the time what happens on the internet stays on the Internet it's it's it's actually

pretty it's it's it's it's pretty

decoupled and then um and that's why

we've had a relatively light regulatory touch on on that stuff vers versus so

many other things and then you know um but there there's no reason you know if

if uh if you had you know I don't know if you had the FDA regulating video

games or regulating AI I I think the progress would slow down a lot 100% that would be a [ __ ]

disaster yeah yeah that would be a disaster but but again it's you know they get to Reg you know yeah Pharmaceuticals are they're not doing a

job with that either I know I know but uh but they you know theide or whatever you know all all these things that went

really Haywire did a good job at people are scared yeah they're not scared of video games they're scared of you know

dangerous Pharmaceuticals and if if um if you if you think of AI as it's not just a video game it's about not just

about this world of bits but it's going to air gap and it's going to affect you your physical world in a real way um you

know maybe um maybe you uh cross the air gap and get the FDA or some other the problem is

they're not good at regulating anything there's no govern agency that you said that you can see that does a stellar job

I I don't I I I think it's but but I I think they have been pretty good at slowing things down and stopping them

and right you know we've we've made a lot less progress on I don't know ex

extending human life we've made no progress on curing Dementia in 40 or 50 years there's all the stuff where um you

know it's been regulated to death which I think is is very bad from the point of view of progress but uh

it is it is pretty effective as a regulation they've stopped stuff they they've been effectively Lite they've

been very effective at being Lites interesting well I I I'm really

considering your perspective on China and AI it's very but but I again these these stories are all like very speculative and like like maybe you you

can the counter argument in mind be something like that's what China thinks

it will be doing but um it will somehow you know um goog go Rogue on them yeah

or they're too arrogant about how much power they think the CCP has and it will go Rogue or so there are sort of I'm not

not at all sure this is this is right but I think I think the man I I think

the US the US one I would say is that

uh um I think the pro aai people in Silicon

Valley are doing a pretty bad job on

let's say convincing people that it's going to be good for them that it's going to be good for the average person

it's going to be good for our society and um and if if it if it all ends up

being and if it all ends up being some version you know um humans are headed

towards the glue factory like a horse um man that's uh that that sort of

probably makes me want to become a lite too well it sucks for us if it's true

but if that's if that's if that's that's the most positive story you can tell then my my I I I don't think that necessarily means we're going to go to

the glue factory I think it means you know the glue factory is getting shut down maybe I don't know if who [ __ ]

runs the glue factory that's the problem I I don't know I'm just speculating too but I'm trying to be objective when I

speculate and I just don't think that this is going to last I don't think that our position as the AP X Predator number

one animal on the planet is going to last I think we're going to create something that surpasses us and I think that's probably what

happens and that's probably what these things are that visit us I think that's what they are I don't I don't think they're biological I think they're

probably what comes after a society develops the kind of technology that we're currently in the middle

of and man the the the the the part that look there all these there all

these places where um there are parts of the story we don't

know right and so it's like how did my my my my general thesis is there

is no evolutionary path to this maybe there's a guided outside alien super

intelligence path for us to become superum and fundamentally benevolent and

fundamentally uh radically different beings but um there's no natural

evolutionary path for this to happen and then I don't know how this would have happened for the alien civilization

presumably there was some but isn't that evolutionary path the invention of superior technology that's a new form of

life no but but but but but the the story you're telling was it can't we can't just leave the humans to the

Natural Evolution because we're still like animals we're still into status all these crazy but those are the things

that motivate us to innovate um and and if we keep innovating at some point we will destroy ourselves

that no no but your your the story telling earlier was you need you need to

have directed in evolution it's like intelligent design it's something it's

like there's some Godlike being that's actually has to take over from Evolution

and guide our cultural and political and biological development no might not have any use for us at all it might just

ignore us and let us live like The Chimps do and then become the superior for force in the planet um it doesn't have to get rid of

us it doesn't have to send us to the glue factory it can let us exist just like put boundaries on I I thought it has to but it has to stop us from

developing this well what if we just end here and we stay Being Human and we can continue with biological evolution as

long as that takes but this new life form now becomes a superior life form on Earth and we still you know we could

still have sex we could still have kids but by the way that's going down our ability to have children is decreasing because of our use of technology which

is wild right our use of plastics and microplastics is causing thades to enter into people's systems it's changing the

development pattern of children to the point it's measurable there's a lot of research that shows that the chemicals

and the environmental factors that we are all experiencing on a daily basis are

radically lowering birth rates radically lowering the ability that men have to develop sperm and more miscarriages all

these things are connected to the chemicals in our environment which is directly connected to our use of Technology it's almost like these things

coincide naturally and they work naturally to the point where we become this sort of feminized thing that

creates this technology that surpasses us and then we just exist for as long as

we do as biological things but now there's a new

thing yeah that's um crazy idea might not be real it's just a

theory but we seem to be moving in a direction of becoming less and less like

animals um yeah I think I think there still are we still have a pretty crazy geopolitical race with China to come

back to that sure you know um the natural development of drone technology in the military context is you need to

take the human out of the loop because the human can get jammed sure and so you need to put an AI on the drones well they're using AI for dog fights and

they're 100% effective against human pilots and so um there sort of are and all these things you know there's

there's a logic to them but um there doesn't seem to be a good end game no the end game doesn't look good

but it's going to be interesting Peter it's definitely going to be interesting

it's interesting right now right um man I do you do you think

the I think all these things are very overdetermined do you think that the

collap in birth rates you know it yeah it could be Plastics but isn't it just

isn't it just a feature of late modernity there's that as well there's there's a feature of um women having

careers right so they want to postpone child sure that's a factor um there's a factor of men being so engrossed in

their career that their testosterone declines lack of sleep stress cortisol levels alcohol consumption a lot of

different things that are factors in uh declining sperm rate sperm count in men

you have miscarriage rates that are up you have a lot of pharmaceutical drugs you get attached to that as well that

have to do with low birth weight or birth rates rather there's a lot of

factors but those factors all seem to be connected to society and our our

civilization and technology in general because the environmental factors all have to do with technology all of them

have to do with inventions and these unnatural factors that are entering into the biological body of human beings and

causing these changes and none of these changes are good in terms of us being able to reproduce and if you factor in

the fact that these changes didn't exist 50 years ago I mean 40 years ago we didn't even have Alzheimer's right so

yeah people didn't get that old no they got that old they got that old the Alzheimer's has to do with the the the

myelin in the human brain it has to do with the fact that myelin is made entirely of cholesterol the the primary

Theory they think now is lack of cholesterol in the diet might be leading to some of these factors you have also environmental things there's like we're

getting poisoned on a daily basis our diets are [ __ ] terrible the things that human being like what percentage of

us are obese it's drink but yeah Diet Coke's great though a few every day you'll be fine I'm not worried about

Diet Coke I'm I'm worried about a lot of things though I'm I'm worried about I think there's a natural progression

that's happening and I think it coincides with the invention of of technology and that it just seems to me to be too coincidental that we don't

notice it that the invention of Technology also leads to

the the the disruption of the sexual reproduction systems of human beings

like boy doesn't that and then if you get to a point where human beings can no longer reproduce sexually which you

could see that P if if we've dropped like human men's male sperm count has dropped something something crazy from

the 1950s to today and continues to do so for the average male and if you just Just Jack that up to a thousand years from now you could

get to a point where there's no longer natural child birth and that people are all having birth through test tubes and

some sort of new invention I'm I'm always I'm always

um let me think uh I think the why why have birth rates collapsed is it's

probably uh it's again an overdetermined story

it's the plastics it's the screens it's

the um you know it's uh it's certain um

you know ways they're not comp children are not compatible with um having a career in late modernity um probably our

economics of it where people can't afford houses or space um um but I'm I'm

probably always a little bit more anchored on um the social and cultural

dimensions of this stuff and uh and again the imitation version of this is

um you know and it's sort of conserved across you know it's people are below the replacement rate in all 50 states of

the US even Mormon Utah the average woman has less than two kids um it's um

Iran is below that Italy way below it South Korea Jaan inal it's all these like it's all these very different types

of societies and so the fact that it's so and then you know Israel is still

sort of a weird exception um and and

then if you ask you know um my my sort

of simplistic somewhat circular explanation would be um you know people

have kids if other people have kids and they stop having kids when other people stop having kids and so there's there's

some there's a dimension of it that's just you know if you're if you're a 27y old woman in Israel you better get

married and you have to keep up with your other friends that are having kids and um and that's and if you don't

you're just like a weirdo who doesn't fit into society or something like that no there's certainly a cultural aspect of and then if you're in South Korea

where I think the total fertility rates like 0.7 it's like onethird of the replacement rate like every generation's

going down by 2/3 or something like this right really F heading towards

Extinction pretty pretty fast um um it is something like probably

none of your friends are doing it and and then and then you're you're you're you're uh you're in this and then and

then probably there are ways it it it shifts the uh the politics in a very

very deep way where um you know once you get an inverted demographic pyramid

where you have way more old people than young people um at some point you know

there's always a question do you vote you know do do you vote for benefits for the old or for the very young do you do

you spend money so Johnny can read or so

Grandma can have a spare leg and um and once you know once the demographic flips

and you get this inverted pyramid maybe the the politics shifts in a very deep way where um the people with kids get

penalized more and more economically it just costs more and more and uh and then the old people without kids just vote

more and more benefits for themselves effectively and then it it just sort of

um you know it's once it flips it may be very hard to reverse I looked at all these sort of heterodox uh demographers

but I'm blanking on the name but there sort of the set of um where you know it's like what are long-term demographic

projections and there's this uh you know if if you know there are 8 billion

people on the planet and you know if every woman has not two babies but one

baby then every generation's half the previous and next generation's 4 billion

M and then and then people think well it's it's just going to it'll eventually you'll have women who want more kids and

it'll just get a smaller population then it will bounce back um uh yeah one of

the Japanese demographers I uh was looking at on this um a few years ago

his thesis was no once it flips it doesn't flip back because you've changed all the politics to where people get dis

incented and so and then you should just extrapolate this as the permanent birth

rate and if it's if it's one on average

of one baby per woman um and you have a

having and then it's in 33 Generations 2

to the 33rd is about 8 billion um and if every generation's 30 years 30 time 33

is 990 years in 990 years you'd predict there'd be one person left on the planet Jesus Christ and um and then then we'd

go extinct if there's only one person left that doesn't work and um and again that's it's a very long-term

extrapolation but the claim is that just

you know once you once you flip it um it it it kicks in all these social and

political Dimensions that are then like yeah maybe it got flipped by the screens

or the Plastics or you know the drugs or other other stuff but once it's flipped

you you change the whole society and it actually stays flipped and it's very very hard to undo that makes sense and

it's more terrifying than my idea but then you know always the but then you know the the you know the weird you know

the weird history on this was you know it was 50 years ago or whatever 1968

Paul Erick writes the population bomb and it's just the population is just going to exponentially grow and um yeah

in theory you can have exponential growth where it doubles you can have exponential decay where it haves every

generation and then in theory there's some stable equilibrium where you know

it's you know everybody has exactly two kids and it's completely stable but it

turns out that that solution is is very very hard to get calibrate and you either yeah and we shifted from

exponential growth to exponential decay and it's probably going to be quite Herculean to get back to something like

stasis well let's end this on a happy note I don't know no

it's yeah that's a terrifying thought and maybe true and maybe what happens but we don't know you know we haven't

gone through it before um but there I think there's a lot of factors like you're saying I think that one's very

compelling and it's scary especially the South Korea thing that's nuts yeah it's always it's always sort

of idiosyncratic there's always things that are idiosyncratic to the society so it's you

know it's it's you know it's it's extremely polarized on the

gender on the gender thing and you know um if you get married with kids you're

you're you're pushed into this super traditional structure the women don't

want to be in that structure they opt out and then um and so there are sort of idiosyncratic things you can say about

East Asia and confusion societies and the way they're not interacting well with modernity but then you know there's

there's a part of it where I wonder with it's just it's just an extreme you know extreme version of it and then I don't know you know my my

some my somewhat fastfall answer is always you know on this stuff is I don't know what to do about these things but my fastfall answer is always the first

step is to talk about them and if you can't even talk about them we're never going to solve them and then maybe that's only the small First Step but

that's that's always sort of my my my fast L I was in I was in South Korea a year and a half ago two two

years ago now and um uh I met um you know one of the CEOs who

ran one of the CH ball one of the Giant conglomerates and I I I I sort of thought this would be a interesting

topic to talk about and uh and then you know it's probably probably all sorts of cultural things I was offending or you you're saying obviously this what are

you going to do about this catastrophic birth rate is my opening question and uh

and then um the way uh you know the way

way he dealt with it was um just turned to me and said uh you're totally right it's a total

disaster and then as soon as you acknowledge it he felt you didn't need to talk about it anymore and we could

move on wow so we have to try to do a little bit better than that

wow because you know I I I I think I think there it is always this strange thing where there's so many of these

things where we can you know where somehow talking about

things is the first step but then it also becomes the excuse for for not

doing not doing more not not really solving them um you know there's all

this probably are all these dietary things where you sort of know what you're supposed to do and then if you

know what you're supposed to do maybe that's that's good enough and you can still have one piece of chocolate before

you go on the diet tomorrow or whatever and uh and so it sort of becomes this you know and so

somehow um figur out a way to turn this knowledge into something actionable is always always a thing that's that's

tricky it's it's it's it's it's sort of where I always find myself very skeptical of

um of you know yeah all these modalities of

therapy where um you know the theory is that uh um

you figure out people's problems and by figuring them out you change them and

then and then it and then ideally it becomes you know an activator for change

and then in practice it often becomes the opposite the way it works is something like this it's like you know

um Psychotherapy gets it gets advertised as self- transformation and um and then after you

spend years in therapy and you maybe you learn a lot of interesting things about s you sort of get exhausted from talking

to the therapist and um at some point it crashes out from self- transformation

into self-acceptance and you realize one day no you're actually just perfect the way you

are and and so it's you know there there these things that that may be very

powerful on the level of of insight and telling us things about ourselves but

then you know do they actually get us to change well that is an interesting thing about talking about things because I

think you're correct that when you talk about things often times this it is a sub you you

are at least in some way avoiding doing those things it's a question yeah in some ways it's a substitute but also you

have to talk about them to understand that you need to do something yeah that's always my excuse I acknowledge but you have to do that and I also realize that it's often my cop out

answer too it could be both things right the problem is taking action and what what action to take and you know the paralysis by analysis where you're just

like trying to figure out what to do and how to do it yeah yeah but I think talking about it is the most important thing strategy is often a euphemism for

procrastination yes it is something like that there's a lot of that going on it's very hard for people to just take steps

they they but they talk about it a lot yeah listen man I really enjoyed talking to you aw it was really fun it was great

great conversation a lot of great insight and a lot of things that I'm going to think about a lot thank you

very much for GL we a all right bye everybody
