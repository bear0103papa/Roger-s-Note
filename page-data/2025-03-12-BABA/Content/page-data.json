Goldfarb (RCG) 的歷史</h2>\n<p>The history of Ruane, Cunniff &#x26; Goldfarb (RCG)</p>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>歡迎來到《價值投資傳奇》第四季！這是一檔深入探討頂級投資者如何挑選股票、管理風險，並在不斷變化的金融環境中持續成功的播客。<p>\n    <p>我是 Thanos Santos，哥倫比亞商學院海爾布倫格雷厄姆與多德投資中心（Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing）的學術主任，同時擔任大衛與艾爾西·多德金融學教授。自 2019 年春季我們播出首集——與 Mario Gabelli 的訪談以來，我們已經建立了一個忠實的全球聽眾群，並累積了一系列與卓越投資者的精彩對話。<p>\n    <p>然而，現在是時候改變節目形式了。雖然我非常享受主持這些訪談，但我一直認為，如果有另一位主持人加入，既能挑戰不同觀點，也能帶來新的洞見，這將讓我們的聽眾與嘉賓獲益匪淺。因此，我非常高興地宣布，我們的新聯合主持人——Michael Mauboussin 加入我們的行列。<p>\n    <p>Michael 不僅是我尊敬的同事和親密的朋友，更是我十分欽佩的投資人，他擅長將學術研究與投資的實務現實相結合。我相信他的加入將為我們的討論帶來獨特視角。許多聽眾可能已經認識 Michael，因為他曾兩次擔任我們的嘉賓。但對於新聽眾，或者錯過那些節目的人，讓我做個簡單介紹。<p>\n    <p>Michael 目前是 Morgan Stanley Investment Management 旗下 Counterpoint Global 的「跨領域研究主管」（Head of Consilient Research）。正如我之前提到的，「跨領域」這個詞彙彷彿是為他量身打造的——他的知識橫跨多個學科，並能將其整合為清晰而有深度的見解。他曾任 Credit Suisse 的全球金融策略主管兼董事總經理，在此之前，他在 Legg Mason Capital Management 擔任首席投資策略師（2004-2012）。<p>\n    <p>Michael 的投資職涯始於 1992 年，在 Credit Suisse 擔任分析師，負責研究包裝食品產業。到了 1999 年，他晉升為首席美國投資策略師。他豐富的經驗與深厚的行業視角，使他成為我們團隊的寶貴資產。<p>\n    <p>除了專業投資人身份外，Michael 也是備受推崇的作家。他的著作包括《成功方程式：拆解商業、運動與投資中的運氣與實力》（The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing），以及我個人最喜歡的一本書——與 Alfred Rappaport 合著的《預期投資：解讀股價以獲取更佳回報》（Expectations Investing: Reading Stock Prices for Better Returns）。該書的第二版目前作為哥倫比亞商學院海爾布倫中心的投資系列之一出版。<p>\n    <p>Michael 自 1993 年以來，一直擔任哥倫比亞商學院的金融學兼任教授，並在海爾布倫中心的發展中發揮了關鍵作用。Michael，歡迎來到《價值投資傳奇》。<p>\n    <p>Michael Mauboussin：謝謝你，Thanos，非常感謝你的讚譽。能夠加入這次旅程，我感到非常榮幸。我一直很欽佩你的工作，也一直享受我們的討論。我對這次合作感到十分興奮，期待與世界頂尖投資者一起探索價值投資的智慧。<p>\n    <p>Thanos Santos：我們很高興你能加入！那麼，現在正式歡迎各位來到新一季的《價值投資傳奇》，這一季我們將由 Michael 作為聯合主持人。<p>\n    <p>為了開啟新一季，我們邀請到價值投資界最具傳奇色彩的公司之一——Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb（RCG）。如果你讀過華倫·巴菲特 1984 年發表在哥倫比亞商學院雜誌上的經典文章《格雷厄姆與多德村的超級投資者》（The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville），那麼你一定對 Bill Ruane 這個名字不陌生。他是這篇文章中巴菲特重點介紹的「超級投資者」之一，也是傳奇性 Sequoia Fund（紅杉基金）的創辦人。<p>\n    <p>Sequoia Fund 在價值投資歷史上佔有重要地位。Bill Ruane 於 1950 年在哥倫比亞大學參加了 Benjamin Graham（本傑明·格雷厄姆）教授的價值投資研討會，並與 Warren Buffett（華倫·巴菲特）結識。當巴菲特於 1969 年關閉其投資合夥企業時，他建議投資人將資金轉移至 Ruane 剛成立的 Sequoia Fund。次年，Bill Ruane 與 Rick Cunniff 正式創立 Sequoia Fund，接收了巴菲特的前客戶。Bob Goldfarb 於 1971 年加入，到了 1970 年代中期，Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb 便已建立起卓越聲譽。<p>\n    <p>秉持價值投資的原則，Sequoia Fund 長期投資並獲利於低估的優質上市公司，例如《華盛頓郵報》（The Washington Post）、Interpublic Group 和 Ogilvy & Mather。1980 年代，基金持有 Kraft、Sara Lee 和 Capital Cities；1990 年代則投資於 Fifth Third Bank、Progressive Insurance、Harley-Davidson 及 Johnson & Johnson，這些投資均帶來豐厚回報。<p>\n    <p>Bill Ruane 幾乎一直管理 Sequoia Fund 直到 2005 年過世。在投資界，很少有人的推薦能比華倫·巴菲特更具份量，而巴菲特曾說：「Ruane 做得非常出色。即便是今天，我也不認識美國有哪支共同基金擁有比 Sequoia Fund 更好的長期績效記錄。」<p>\n    <p>今天，Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb 的價值投資傳承依然延續，並不僅限於 Sequoia Fund。我們今天非常榮幸邀請到 Chase Sheridan 和 Will Pan，來分享這家公司的發展，以及其傳奇歷史的新篇章。<p>\n    <p>Chase 和 Will 分別於 2006 年和 2010 年加入 Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb，起初都是分析師。2019 年，他們推出了 Hyperion Fund，開啟了這家傳奇公司的新時代。<p>\n    <p>Chase 於 2006 年從哥倫比亞商學院畢業，並在畢業後直接加入公司。Will 則畢業於哈佛大學（Harvard College），2010 年起便一直在 Ruane 工作至今。<p>\n    <p>Chase、Will，歡迎來到《價值投資傳奇》，感謝你們的到來！<p>\n    <p>Chase Sheridan & Will Pan：感謝邀請我們，很高興見到你們兩位！<p>\n    <p>Thanos Santos：我們節目的一大傳統，就是從嘉賓的職業旅程開始聊起。Chase，我們先從你開始吧。你在加入 Ruane 之前的職業發展是怎樣的？你在商學院之前就有工作經驗，而 Will 則沒有。是什麼讓你最終選擇了 Ruane？<p>\n    <p>Chase Sheridan：當然可以！我的職業道路有些非典型，我的投資管理生涯其實始於芝加哥期權交易所（Chicago Board Options Exchange，CBOE）的交易大廳。我在芝加哥郊區長大，1990 年代中期，如果你對金融感興趣，並渴望獲得實戰經驗，那麼交易所的交易大廳是個令人驚嘆的起點。在那裡，年輕人能夠非常早地承擔真正的責任……</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Welcome to the fourth season of Value Investing with Legends, a podcast that delves deep into the strategies and principles that top investors use to select stocks and manage risk in an ever-evolving financial landscape.<p>\n    <p>I’m Thanos Santos, Faculty Director of the Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing at Columbia Business School and the David and Elsie Dodd Professor of Finance. Since launching our first episode in the spring of 2019—an interview with Mario Gabelli—we’ve built a dedicated global audience and amassed an impressive collection of conversations with extraordinary investors.<p>\n    <p>However, it’s time for a change in format. While I’ve truly enjoyed hosting these interviews, I’ve always believed that both our audience and guests would benefit from another voice—someone who could challenge perspectives and bring fresh insights. That’s why I’m thrilled to welcome my new co-host, Michael Mauboussin.<p>\n    <p>Michael is not only a respected colleague and a close friend, but he’s also someone I deeply admire for his ability to bridge academic research with the practical realities of investing. I’m confident he will add a unique perspective to our discussions. Many of our listeners already know Michael, as he’s been a guest on the podcast twice. But for those who are new or may have missed those episodes, let me provide a brief introduction.<p>\n    <p>Michael is the Head of Consilient Research at Counterpoint Global, a division of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. As I’ve mentioned before, the term “consilient” could have been coined just for him—his knowledge spans multiple disciplines, and he has a remarkable ability to synthesize them into coherent and intelligent insights. Previously, he was Managing Director and Head of Global Financial Strategies at Credit Suisse. Before that, he served as Chief Investment Strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management from 2004 to 2012.<p>\n    <p>Michael’s career began at Credit Suisse in 1992 as an analyst covering the packaged food industry, and by 1999, he had risen to the role of Chief U.S. Investment Strategist. His extensive experience and deep industry perspective make him an invaluable addition to our team.<p>\n    <p>Beyond his professional roles, Michael is also a highly regarded author. His books include The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing, as well as my personal favorite, Expectations Investing: Reading Stock Prices for Better Returns, co-authored with Alfred Rappaport. The second edition of this book is now being released as part of the Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing series.<p>\n    Michael has also been an adjunct professor of finance at Columbia Business School since 1993 and plays a key role in the success of the Heilbrunn Center. Michael, welcome to Value Investing with Legends.<p>\n    <p>Michael Mauboussin: Thank you, Thanos, for the kind words. It’s a pleasure to join you on this journey. I’ve long admired your work, and I’ve always enjoyed our discussions. I’m really excited about this opportunity to collaborate and explore the insights of some of the world’s greatest investors.<p>\n    <p>Thanos Santos: We’re delighted to have you. And with that, welcome to the first episode of this new season of Value Investing with Legends, now with Mike as my co-host.<p>\n    <p>To kick things off, we’re featuring one of the most legendary names in value investing—Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb (RCG). If you’ve read Warren Buffett’s famous essay, The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, published in the Columbia Business School Magazine in 1984, you’ll recognize the name Bill Ruane. He was one of the “superinvestors” Buffett highlighted, as well as the founder of the legendary Sequoia Fund.<p>\n    <p>The Sequoia Fund holds a prominent place in the history of value investing. Bill Ruane first met Warren Buffett in 1950 at a value investing seminar taught by Benjamin Graham at Columbia University. When Buffett closed his investment partnership in 1969, he advised his investors to move their money into Ruane’s newly established Sequoia Fund. The following year, Bill Ruane and Rick Cunniff officially launched the fund, taking on Buffett’s former clients. Bob Goldfarb joined the firm in 1971, and by the mid-1970s, Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb had built an outstanding reputation.<p>\n    <p>Staying true to the principles of value investing, the fund identified and profited from undervalued public companies, including The Washington Post, Interpublic Group, and Ogilvy & Mather. In the 1980s, it held stakes in Kraft, Sara Lee, and Capital Cities. The 1990s brought investments in Fifth Third Bank, Progressive Insurance, Harley-Davidson, and Johnson & Johnson, all of which were sold at substantial profits.<p>\n    <p>Bill Ruane managed the Sequoia Fund nearly until his passing in 2005. Few endorsements carry as much weight in the investment community as those from Warren Buffett, who once said, “[Ruane] did a fantastic job. Even today, if you look at its long-term record, I don’t know of a mutual fund in the United States with a better track record.”<p>\n    <p>The legacy of value investing at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb continues to thrive beyond the Sequoia Fund. Today, we’re honored to welcome Chase Sheridan and Will Pan, who will share insights on the firm’s evolution and the next chapter in its storied history.<p>\n    <p>Chase and Will joined the firm in 2006 and 2010, respectively, starting as analysts. In 2019, they launched the Hyperion Fund, marking a new era for Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.<p>\n    <p>Chase is a 2006 graduate of Columbia Business School and joined the firm straight out of school. Will graduated from Harvard College in 2010 and has been with Ruane ever since.<p>\n    <p>Chase, Will, welcome to Value Investing with Legends, and thank you for being here.<p>\n    <p>Chase Sheridan & Will Pan: Thank you for having us. It’s always a pleasure to see you both.<p>\n    <p>Thanos Santos: As always, we like to begin by getting to know our guests and their career journeys. Chase, let’s start with you. Before joining Ruane, what was your path like? You had prior experience before business school, unlike Will. What led you to Ruane?<p>\n    <p>Chase Sheridan: Absolutely. My journey to Ruane was rather unconventional. My career in investment management actually started on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, and back in the mid-1990s, if you were interested in finance and eager to gain hands-on experience, the trading floor was an incredible place to start. It was an environment where young professionals could take on real responsibility early on.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"chases-unusual-path-to-rcg-637\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chases-unusual-path-to-rcg-637\" aria-label=\"chases unusual path to rcg 637 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chase’s unusual path to RCG (6:37)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>我最初的職業生涯是在標普 500 期權市場擔任造市商，後來轉向一個較為專門的領域，稱為波動率套利（volatility arbitrage）或分散交易（dispersion trading）。在 1990 年代，這仍然是一個相對新穎的概念。儘管技術細節在這裡並不重要，但關鍵是我在 Cooper Neff 擔任期權交易員，這家公司提供了極佳的工作環境，而我也真正熱愛這份工作。<p>\n    <p>然而，每到年底領取獎金時，我總會意識到自己完全不知道該如何投資這筆錢。我並不真正理解「投資」的意義。幸運的是，我的一位至親好友從 1971 年起便是 Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb 最早的一批客戶。在蒙大拿州的一次滑雪旅行中，這位朋友熱情地向我談論他的資產管理人 Bob Goldfarb，以及 Ruane, Cunniff 所做的卓越投資決策。我被這番話深深吸引，於是請他介紹我給這家公司認識。<p>\n    <p>起初，我只是成為 Ruane, Cunniff 的客戶，把每年的獎金交由他們管理。隨著時間的推移，我將全部資產都託付給他們。在這段關係中，我對價值投資產生了濃厚興趣，甚至開始與父親一起參加在奧馬哈舉行的波克夏·海瑟威（Berkshire Hathaway）年度股東大會。和許多投資人一樣，華倫·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）投資哲學的簡潔與智慧深深吸引了我。<p>\n    <p>最終，我決定徹底轉變自己的職業生涯，全心投入價值投資。為了達成這個目標，我回到學校求學——並非為了取得 MBA，而是專門為了就讀哥倫比亞大學的價值投資課程（Value Investing Program）。這是我唯一的目標。如果當初沒有獲得哥倫比亞的錄取，我很可能根本不會選擇攻讀商學院。幸運的是，我順利進入這個項目，而那兩年成為了我人生中最美好的時光之一。<p>\n    <p>價值投資課程的學習經驗極為出色。我選修了 Mike（Michael Mauboussin）的證券分析課程，這門課對我影響深遠——時至今日，我仍然在日常工作中應用課堂所學。儘管當時我並不確定自己是否有機會進入 Ruane, Cunniff 工作，但這間公司正是讓我愛上價值投資的原因。命運使然，他們恰好有一個職位空缺，於是我在課程進行到一半時便獲得了錄取機會。<p>\n    <p>和許多剛進入 Ruane, Cunniff 的年輕分析師一樣，我從未詢問薪資或福利條件——我只想擁有與這些卓越投資人共事的機會。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>I started my career as a market maker in S&P 500 options before transitioning into a specialized area called volatility arbitrage or dispersion trading. In the 1990s, this was still a relatively new concept, and while the technical details aren’t particularly relevant here, the key takeaway is that I built a career as an options trader at Cooper Neff, a firm that provided an excellent work environment. I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing.<p>\n    <p>However, at the end of each year, I would receive my bonus and realize that I had no idea how to invest it. I didn’t truly understand real investing. Fortunately, a close family friend was one of the earliest clients of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, dating back to 1971. During a ski trip in Montana, this friend spoke passionately about his money manager, Bob Goldfarb, and the remarkable work being done at Ruane, Cunniff. Intrigued, I asked for an introduction.<p>\n    <p>I initially became a client, entrusting them with my annual bonuses, and before long, they were managing all my assets. Through this relationship, I developed a deep interest in value investing and even started attending the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings in Omaha with my father. Like many others, I was captivated by the elegance of Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy.<p>\n    <p>At a certain point, I decided to completely reshape my career in order to pursue value investing. I returned to school—not so much for an MBA, but specifically to enroll in Columbia’s Value Investing Program. That was my sole focus; had I not been accepted into Columbia, I likely wouldn’t have pursued business school at all. Fortunately, I was admitted, and those two years turned out to be among the best of my life.<p>\n    <p>The Value Investing Program was phenomenal. I took Mike’s class on security analysis, which I found incredibly valuable—many of the lessons I learned in that course still influence my work today. While I wasn’t sure whether I’d ever land a job at Ruane, Cunniff, that firm was the reason I fell in love with value investing in the first place. As luck would have it, they happened to have an opening, and they hired me midway through the program.<p>\n    <p>Like many young analysts at Ruane, Cunniff, I didn’t ask about salary or benefits—I just wanted the opportunity to work with these extraordinary investors.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"how-chase-became-interested-in-value-investing-836\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-chase-became-interested-in-value-investing-836\" aria-label=\"how chase became interested in value investing 836 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How Chase became interested in value investing (8:36)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>我有幸與那些我深深敬仰的卓越投資人共事，從加入公司的那一刻起，他們就讓我全力投入工作。自那時起，我便一直留在這家公司。這就是我通往 Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb 的非典型之路。<p>\n    <p>那麼你呢，Will？你在學校主修什麼？資產管理一直是你的職業目標嗎？<p>\n    <p>我從小就對股票產生興趣。我的父親在 1990 年代積極參與股市投資——或許可以說是過於積極了——但他很早就讓我接觸投資，而那時我第一次聽說了華倫·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）。<p>\n    <p>在大學期間，我主修經濟學，並在麻省理工學院（MIT）修了一門會計課，因為當時哈佛並未開設這門課程。此外，我也研究了神經科學，因為當時行為經濟學正迅速崛起，而我對「人們並不總是理性且經常犯錯」這一觀點深感著迷。這種視角至今仍然影響著我的投資思維。<p>\n    <p>在哈佛求學期間，我擔任行為經濟學大師 David Laibson 的研究助理，他在該領域做出了開創性的貢獻。此外，我也參與了學生投資社團，管理學生投資基金，並撰寫投資提案。同時，我也探索了其他興趣領域，包括創業和科技產業。我唯一確定的是，我想投身於商業領域，因為企業運作讓我著迷。<p>\n    <p>2009 年夏天，我面臨大三暑期實習的選擇，而這成為我職業道路的轉捩點。我面前有幾條不同的選擇：我可以進入諮詢產業，或者在一家大型科技公司擔任項目管理職位。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>I had the privilege of working with incredible investors whom I deeply admired, and from the moment I joined, they put me to work. I’ve been with the firm ever since. That was my rather unconventional path to Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.<p>\n    <p>And what about you, Will? What did you study in school? Was a career in asset management always your goal?<p>\n    <p>I was interested in stocks from a young age. My dad was very active in the stock market during the 1990s—perhaps a little too active—but he involved me in investing early on, and that’s when I first learned about Warren Buffett.<p>\n    <p>In college, I majored in economics and took an accounting class at MIT, since Harvard didn’t offer one at the time. I also studied neuroscience, as behavioral economics was emerging as a major field, and I was fascinated by the idea that people aren’t always rational and often make mistakes. That perspective continues to shape how I think about investing today.<p>\n    <p>During my time at Harvard, I worked as a research assistant for David Laibson, who has done groundbreaking work in behavioral economics. I also participated in student investment clubs, contributed to student-managed funds, and wrote investment pitches. At the same time, I explored other interests, including startups and tech. What I knew for certain was that I wanted to be in business—companies fascinated me.<p>\n    <p>Everything came to a head in the summer of 2009 when I was deciding on my junior-year internship.

It’s not often in life that we realize how lucky we are in a given moment, but I think I was fortunate enough to recognize that interning at Ruane would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I set my heart on it because I knew I would learn a tremendous amount about business—knowledge that would be valuable no matter what path I ultimately chose.<p>\n    <p>It was actually quite funny because the recruiter from the big tech company kept calling me, increasing their offer, thinking he was competing against a major Wall Street firm. But at the time, Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb hadn’t really updated its pay structure—we were paid a $1,000-per-week stipend. So, ironically, he was already offering the highest compensation, but I was never in it for the money. I just wanted to take a shot at this incredible opportunity, even though I knew Ruane didn’t hire interns every year and there was no guarantee of a full-time position.<p>\n    <p>I did the internship, and I loved every minute of it—the work, the people, the environment. So, I was absolutely thrilled when they invited me to join full-time, and I’ve been here ever since.<p>\n    <p>There are so many interesting connections here. Michael and I, of course, have immersed ourselves in the literature on behavioral economics. I still vividly remember when David Laibson’s work on hyperbolic discounting first made waves in academia—it was a major shock to the field and had a profound impact. Chase, your career path also resonates with mine in academia. I started my teaching career at the University of Chicago, covering options, futures, and fixed-income derivatives. It was around 2009–2010 that I first started reading Ben Graham, while working with Bruce Greenwald here at Columbia Business School. Like you, once I dove into that world, there was no turning back.<p>\n    <p>The bulk of our discussion today will focus on your work at Hyperion Fund. We’re very curious about this new name in the investment world. We read the letter you kindly sent us, where you emphasized the deep connection you both share with Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb. Can you elaborate on that tradition? How do you build upon Ruane’s legacy, why is it still relevant today, and how are you applying those principles within Hyperion?<p>\n    <p>I’d say the essence of how we invest—both at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and now at Hyperion—is that we view stocks as ownership in businesses. That might sound like a cliché, as many people say it, but we truly, deeply believe it. When we hold a stock in our portfolio, we don’t see it as just a fluctuating line on a screen or a piece of paper to be traded. It represents a partnership—a real ownership stake in a business. Our goal is to understand that business as thoroughly as possible, to analyze the people running it with the same depth, and to assess whether we are getting fair value based on where the stock is trading.<p>\n    <p>Chase, anything you’d like to add?<p>\n    <p>I’d just emphasize that when you invest with this philosophy, there are no shortcuts. At Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, there’s no rigid research budget or predefined time limit for analyzing a company. You work on it until you truly understand it, no matter how long that takes. I think that approach is increasingly rare, even today, on Wall Street. We refuse to cut corners.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-core-of-the-rcg-investment-approach-1352\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-core-of-the-rcg-investment-approach-1352\" aria-label=\"the core of the rcg investment approach 1352 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The core of the RCG investment approach (13:52)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>研究過程是我們投資方法的核心。我們進行深入研究的目的，是發掘與分析那些表面上不易察覺，或被市場低估的經濟驅動因素。這種深入分析一直是我們的標誌，我們相信這是一種歷久彌新的能力，只要 Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb 存在，它就會是投資過程中不可或缺的一環。<p>\n    <p>我想進一步探討這個問題。當人們談論價值投資時，通常會聯想到購買那些在統計數據上看起來便宜的股票——例如低本益比（P/E）、低股價淨值比（P/B）等。然而，價值投資還有另一層定義：以低於內在價值的價格購買企業股份，也就是以折扣價取得一家公司的所有權。聽你們的描述，你們似乎更關注後者，而非前者。那麼，有人會質疑你們說：「你們其實不是價值投資人，因為你們並沒有買便宜的股票。」你們如何看待這兩種價值投資的觀點？<p>\n    <p>我們的關注點始終是企業的「內在獲利能力」（intrinsic earnings power）。這可能意味著投資於在統計數據上看起來便宜的公司，例如我們目前投資組合中的 Credit Acceptance，其本益比僅有個位數。也可能意味著投資於一家公司，表面上看起來估值昂貴，例如我們曾以 GAAP 本益比 150 倍的價格買入 Amazon，但根據我們對其內在收益的估算，這其實是一個非常合理的估值。<p>\n    <p>歸根結底，一切都取決於企業的內在獲利能力。這樣的關注點可能與傳統的估值指標並不完全對應，因此我們投資組合中的某些公司，看起來在傳統的篩選標準下表現很糟糕。原因在於，許多企業正積極投資於成長計畫，這些計畫可能帶來長遠的價值增長，但短期內會壓低其報告出來的利潤率。<p>\n    <p>我們往往會被這些機會吸引，因為當一支股票在篩選結果中表現不佳時，它通常較少受到成熟投資人的關注，這就為我們提供了利用市場低效性的機會。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>The research process is fundamental to our approach. The purpose and benefit of conducting deep research as we do is to uncover and analyze economic drivers that may not be immediately apparent—or that may be underappreciated by the broader market. That depth of analysis has always been our hallmark, and we believe it is a timeless attribute that will remain a crucial part of investing for as long as Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb exists.<p>\n    <p>I’d like to follow up on that. When people think of value investing, they often associate it with buying stocks that appear statistically cheap—low price-to-earnings, low price-to-book ratios. But there's another definition of value investing: buying something for less than what it's truly worth, meaning acquiring a stake in a business at a discount to its intrinsic value. From what you’re describing, it sounds like you focus far more on the latter than the former. Do people ever challenge you by saying, \"You’re not really value investors because you’re not buying cheap stocks?\" How do you reconcile those two perspectives?<p>\n    <p>We are laser-focused on the intrinsic earnings power of a business. That can mean investing in a company that appears statistically cheap—such as Credit Acceptance, which currently trades at a single-digit multiple of earnings in our portfolio. Or it can mean investing in a company that, on the surface, looks expensive—like when we bought Amazon at 150 times GAAP earnings, but at what we believed was a very reasonable multiple of our intrinsic earnings estimate.<p>\n    <p>At the end of the day, everything comes down to intrinsic earnings power. That focus may or may not align with traditional valuation metrics that make a stock screen cheaply. In fact, some businesses in our portfolio look terrible based on conventional screening metrics. The reason? Many of them are investing heavily in growth initiatives that could drive significant long-term value but temporarily suppress their reported margins.<p>\n    <p>We’re often attracted to these situations because when a stock screens poorly, it tends to attract fewer sophisticated investors. That, in turn, creates opportunities for us to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"hyperions-maniacal-focus-on-the-intrinsic-earnings-power-of-a-business-1559\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hyperions-maniacal-focus-on-the-intrinsic-earnings-power-of-a-business-1559\" aria-label=\"hyperions maniacal focus on the intrinsic earnings power of a business 1559 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hyperion’s maniacal focus on the intrinsic earnings power of a business (15:59)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>在我們深入探討你們的投資方法——包括估值方式、選股策略等細節之前，能否先簡要介紹一下 Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb（RCG）的當前架構？你們擁有一個共同的研究平台，涵蓋多個投資工具。能否說明這個運作方式，以及 Hyperion 與 RCG 之間的關係？<p>\n    <p>許多人認為 RCG 只是 Sequoia 共同基金的管理者，但實際上，我們早已經管理多個基金。我們的所有基金都共享一個強大的研究團隊，這個團隊每天都在進行高品質的分析。我們所有的基金都建立在相同的投資理念之上，並且依賴相同的核心研究成果。然而，每支基金對這一理念的詮釋和應用方式有所不同，而 Hyperion 是我們家族中最新的成員。<p>\n    <p>其實，Hyperion 這個名稱本身就透露出它在我們體系中的定位——Hyperion 是目前已知最高的紅杉樹（sequoia tree）。所以，雖然這個名字可能讓人聯想到希臘神話，但我們仍然延續了「紅杉」的主題。<p>\n    <p>老實說，剛開始聽到這個名字時，我也有點困惑，所以很感謝你的解釋。<p>\n    <p>可以這麼說，Hyperion 是我們相同核心投資理念的另一種表達方式，就像是一道甜點的不同風味版本。關鍵區別在於，它所服務的客戶群體與我們的旗艦基金 Sequoia 略有不同。Sequoia 的一個特殊之處在於，它的許多投資人是個人投資者，其中一些人的全部資產都投入了這支基金，或者透過與其高度相似的單獨管理帳戶（separately managed accounts）來投資。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Before we dive into the details of your methodology—how you approach valuation, stock selection, and so on—can you first give us a brief overview of the current structure of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb? You have a common research platform that spans multiple investment vehicles. Can you clarify how that works and explain the relationship between Hyperion and Ruane?<p>\n    <p>Many people think of RCG solely as the manager of the Sequoia Mutual Fund, but we’ve long been home to additional funds as well. Across all our funds, we have a deep research talent pool that produces high-quality analysis every day. All our funds are rooted in the same investment philosophy we’ve been discussing, and they all draw from the same core research. However, each represents a different interpretation or variation of that philosophy. Hyperion is the latest addition to that family.<p>\n    <p>The name itself gives some insight into its place within our ecosystem—Hyperion is actually the name of the tallest known sequoia tree. So while it might seem like we’re branching into Greek mythology, we’re still sticking with the sequoia theme.<p>\n    <p>I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled by the name at first, so I appreciate the clarification.<p>\n    <p>Hyperion is essentially another expression of the same core philosophy—it’s a different flavor of the same dessert. The key distinction is that it serves a slightly different client base than our flagship Sequoia Fund. Sequoia is somewhat unique in that many of its clients are individual investors, with some having their entire net worth tied up in the fund or in separately managed accounts that closely mirror it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-relationship-between-rcg-and-hyperion-1726\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-relationship-between-rcg-and-hyperion-1726\" aria-label=\"the relationship between rcg and hyperion 1726 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The relationship between RCG and Hyperion (17:26)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>我們非常清楚，Sequoia 的許多客戶是個人投資者，這也影響了我們為他們投資的方式。而 Hyperion 則主要面向機構客戶，因此在投資組合管理上採取了略有不同的方法。<p>\n    <p>由於我們的觀眾中有許多分析師和學生，在課堂上經常被問到的一個問題是，從分析師晉升為投資組合經理（Portfolio Manager, PM）的職涯發展路徑。你們能否分享一下自己在公司內的職業發展歷程？從分析師到投資組合經理的轉變是如何發生的？更重要的是，分析師和投資組合經理之間有哪些共同的核心技能？</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>We’re very aware of the fact that many of our Sequoia clients are individual investors, and that shapes the way we invest on their behalf.

We all consider ourselves analysts first and foremost. Even if you do end up being responsible for a portfolio and making decisions for a portfolio, you still do analysis work. You do your own research projects, partner with others on research, and that really is the utility player at our firm. We think portfolio management is relatively simple if you do a good job on the research and the analysis.

What is it about launching on your own that lets you do things you wouldn’t be able to do otherwise?<p>\n    <p>Hyperion was really launched at the request of certain institutional clients who asked us to create a vehicle that was A) even more concentrated than Sequoia, and B) fully invested at all times. The first client in Hyperion was someone for whom we had been managing a more concentrated portfolio for a number of years. We made an exception for that client, and it gave us an inkling that this might be a product that would be well-received by our existing institutional client base. So, it was really in response to their needs, and it wasn’t so much a vehicle for Will and me. In fact, we conceived of Hyperion before we knew or decided who would be managing it.<p>\n    <p>Now, of course, it reflects the natural inclinations that Will and I have—our preferences. We tend to have very similar preferences for the kinds of businesses we like, and I think that’s why we ended up paired as portfolio managers for Hyperion.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-founding-of-hyperion-2130\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-founding-of-hyperion-2130\" aria-label=\"the founding of hyperion 2130 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The founding of Hyperion (21:30)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Will: 沒錯，我們一直在努力在這之間找到平衡。我們認為，多元觀點對於良好的決策至關重要。現在整個公司內部也都傾向採取更團隊導向的方式來管理資金。而對於 Chase 和我來說，正如他剛才提到的，我們的投資理念高度一致，對於企業的選擇標準相當相近，因此由我們共同管理 Hyperion 可說是水到渠成。<p>\n    <p>其實有個蠻有趣的故事。在我們剛開始管理基金時，我們擔心會因為想法過於相似而落入「群體思維」(groupthink) 的陷阱。於是我們決定各自獨立地在辦公室裡建構自己的理想投資組合，然後再來比對看看會有什麼不同之處。<p>\n    <p>結果當我們把各自的投資組合放在一起時，發現它們驚人地相似。不僅選擇的標的大致相同，就連權重的排序都非常接近。這讓我們意識到，即使我們刻意分開思考，最終還是會回歸到相同的分析框架和投資邏輯。因此，我們持續提醒自己要避免「群體思維」，我們仍然堅持獨立進行研究，確保我們帶入不同的視角，並對彼此的觀點提出挑戰。<p>\n    <p>但整體來說，我們的合作非常順暢，因為我們大部分時候的想法都一致。至今我們還沒有遇過「一人贊成、一人反對」的僵局，每當意見有分歧時，我們會透過辯論來說服對方，最終達成共識。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 哈哈，現在你們知道了，我們不只是共同管理基金，還在學習彼此的行為偏誤，並想辦法控制它們！</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Interviewer: And it’s only you two, Chase, co-managing the portfolio—just you and Will?<p>\n    <p>Chase: Yes, it's just Will and I as co-managers. It’s entirely at our discretion.<p>\n    <p>Interviewer: One question I want to ask is a fascinating observation in the investment management industry. Funds, maybe a generation or two ago, and certainly when Sequoia was launched 50 years ago, were almost always single-person managed—one portfolio manager. And increasingly now, I think more than three-quarters of them are team-managed. I’d love to hear your thoughts on that. Obviously, we have a team managing this fund. Have you evolved that, and what are the pros and cons of working in a team?<p>\n    <p>The pros would be you get different points of view and different sets of experiences. The con might be accountability—who makes the ultimate decision? So, how do you handle that balance between the benefits of working together and the challenges that might arise?<p>\n    <p>Will: It's interesting. We’re always trying to strike that balance. We do think diversity of opinion is important for good decision-making. You’ll find that throughout the firm now, we're taking much more of a team-based approach. For Chase and me specifically, like Chase was saying, we found ourselves aligned in a lot of ways. We like the same kinds of stocks, we work on the same types of projects, so it was very natural for us.<p>\n    <p>And it’s kind of a funny story. When we started the fund, we said, “Well, we don’t want to succumb to groupthink.” We know that we think very similarly, so let’s go away into our respective offices, and each of us will construct the portfolios that we individually would want this to look like.<p>\n    <p>Then we came back, and the portfolios were remarkably similar. We were both surprised not only by the fact that we selected mostly the same things, but that they were also weighted in roughly the same rank order. So, we are constantly trying to make sure we don’t fall into groupthink, that we do our work independently to bring diverse perspectives to the table.<p>\n    <p>But it’s a very smooth working relationship because we are so often on the same page. We’ve never run into a situation where it’s one vote for and one vote against, causing a stalemate. We’ve always been able to convince each other when we do disagree. We just debate it out and come to a decision.<p>\n    <p>Chase: Now you guys are learning about each other's behavioral biases at the same time and figuring out how to control them!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"chase-and-wills-co-manager-dynamic-2318\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chase-and-wills-co-manager-dynamic-2318\" aria-label=\"chase and wills co manager dynamic 2318 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chase and Will’s co-manager dynamic (23:18)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase: 我知道 Chase 喜歡這樣，或者我知道 Will 喜歡這樣。<p>\n    <p>Will: 哦，當然。我們早就知道彼此的偏好，不過這確實是一個持續的過程。我們會做一些事情來幫助自己更好地了解，像是檢查我們的交易日誌。我們會回顧我們的決策，並與彼此討論，分析這是好決策但結果不好，還是壞決策但結果好，或者是兩者都不理想。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 我們不斷地學習關於自己個人以及作為團隊如何運作的東西，我們試著將這些學到的東西融入到回饋循環中。<p>\n    <p>Will: 我想在這裡做個說明，雖然 Sequoia 當然和 Bill Ruane 密切相關，但 Sequoia 的管理其實從一開始就是團隊合作。Bill、Bob 和 Rick 當時其實是三人合作經營。這不是一個人主導的局面，Bill 當然是精神領袖，但那時候其實也是團隊合作。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 而且，如你所知，Sequoia 現在是由委員會管理的。它由四個人組成的團隊管理。我們喜歡這種動態，也希望把它帶到 Hyperion。我們不想讓 Hyperion 只有一位經理。我們希望至少有兩個人來管理，現在看起來兩個人合作挺順利的。<p>\n    <p>Will: Mike，我覺得你可能會說，數據顯示三個人通常是最佳組合，但到目前為止，我們並沒有遇到什麼問題，這樣合作對我們來說挺有效的。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase: I know Chase likes this, or I know Will likes this.<p>\n    <p>Will: Oh, of course. And we’ve known about these preferences for a long time as well, but it certainly is an ongoing process. We do things like investigate our trade ledger. We go through the decisions and talk them through with each other, analyzing whether this was a good decision with a good outcome, a bad decision with a good outcome, a good decision with a bad outcome, or a bad decision with a bad outcome.<p>\n    <p>Chase: We’re constantly learning about ourselves individually and how we function as a team, and we try to incorporate that into the feedback loop.<p>\n    <p>Will: I just want to make a note here, which is that while Sequoia is, of course, associated with Bill Ruane, the management of Sequoia was very much a team effort from the very beginning. Bill, Bob, and Rick really operated as a triumvirate. It wasn’t just a one-man show. Bill was obviously the spiritual leader, but it was a team effort even back then.<p>\n    <p>Chase: And, as you know, Sequoia is now committee-managed. It's managed by a team of four people. We liked that dynamic and wanted to bring it to Hyperion. We didn’t want a sole manager at Hyperion. We wanted at least two people, and two seems to be working well at the moment.<p>\n    <p>Will: Mike, I think you would probably say that the data suggests three is usually the optimal number, but so far, we haven’t run into any issues. It seems to be working for us.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-team-management-of-a-fund-2530\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#benefits-of-team-management-of-a-fund-2530\" aria-label=\"benefits of team management of a fund 2530 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Benefits of team management of a fund (25:30)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Will: 我可以回到你剛才提到的一個問題，我覺得很有意思嗎？其實我會在我的課堂上講這個問題。你提到了交易日誌以及如何追蹤你的決策過程。特定投資背後的假設是什麼？你能再多談談這個嗎？我一直認為交易日誌和某種日記的概念是一個很棒的主意。你能告訴我們更多關於你們如何利用它來改善決策過程的內容嗎？<p>\n    <p>Chase: 當然，我們定期這樣做。我們會下載交易日誌，並檢查基於我們買入和賣出的股票隨後的表現，看看這是否是一次好的決策。老實說，我們應該在交易時更好地記錄我們的決策過程，但我們仍然可以回顧並了解當時我們的思考。<p>\n    <p>Will: 我們公司還有一個習慣，那就是寫很多東西。有一個我們寫的東西是 Chase 引入的——投資假設備忘錄。我們定期更新對某只股票的假設，也許這個想法是受你啟發的 Mike，因為它很像一個假設，也像是一種事後檢討。我們會問自己：“會有什麼問題？會有什麼好事？”我們會保持這些記錄的更新，這樣我們就能夠記錄下當時我們的想法，因為稍後回顧時，很容易就會製造出自己當時的思維過程。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Will: Can I go back to something you said just a minute ago that I found quite interesting? I actually lecture on this to my students. You mentioned a trade ledger and how important it is to track your decision-making process. What was the thesis behind a particular investment? Can you elaborate a bit on that? I’ve always thought a trade ledger and a diary of sorts is a great idea. Can you tell us a little more about how you guys utilize it to improve your decision-making?<p>\n    <p>Chase: Sure. We do this on a regular basis. We download our trade ledger and go through it, checking to see, based on the subsequent performance of the stocks we bought and sold, whether it was a good decision or not. Honestly, we could do a better job of documenting our decision-making at the time of the trade, but we can always look back and see what we were thinking.<p>\n    <p>Will: We also have a practice at the firm of writing a lot. One thing we write, which Chase introduced, is thesis memos. We regularly update the thesis on a stock, and maybe this was inspired by you, Mike, because it’s similar to a thesis but also a sort of pre-mortem. We ask ourselves, \"What could go wrong? What could go right?\" We try to keep these updated so that we have a record of what we were thinking at any given time, because it’s so easy to later just manufacture what we thought.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"analyzing-your-trade-ledger-and-thesis-memos-2652\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#analyzing-your-trade-ledger-and-thesis-memos-2652\" aria-label=\"analyzing your trade ledger and thesis memos 2652 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Analyzing your trade ledger and thesis memos (26:52)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Mike: 我實際上認為這非常重要。在價值投資中，有一個很好的傳統，那就是做一個好的寫作者。我認為寫作會迫使你放慢思考的速度，仔細考慮你的投資假設以及它的緊密程度。我不知道你們是否同意這一點。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 我完全同意。<p>\n    <p>Mike: 另外，我想追問的是：你們是否注意到任何有趣的模式？比如說，你們是否會買得太早、買得太晚、賣得太早、賣得太晚？或者是否有任何規模問題？你們是否觀察到一些行為，這些行為幫助你們在未來變得更好？<p>\n    <p>Will: 我來說一下這個問題，想強調一下 Chase 提到的 Ruane, Cunniff 是一個寫作文化。我們從第一次通話到最後一個都會記錄下來，因此我們有一個內部的研究系統，分析師們會不斷提交備忘錄。我記得最近有第三方聯繫我們，想要推銷他們的服務，他們說：“我們擁有超過 10,000 篇來自不同通話的記錄，你應該訂閱我們的服務，因為這樣你將能夠訪問這麼多的工作資料。”我對他們說：“你們的內部資料庫根本無法比擬。我等你們的資料庫比我們還要大時再打電話給我。”<p>\n    <p>我們這裡有關於數千家公司已經記錄的研究資料，所有這些研究都有日期和股票價格。我們可以回顧——不僅僅是交易決策，而且每一個研究過程的步驟——我們當時在哪裡，當時在想什麼，這一切都有書面記錄。這是一個無價的資源。<p>\n    <p>我認為通過我們定期進行的內省和反思，這也引導了 Will 和我走向今天我們喜歡的那些公司。所以，如果你問我，比如說，在我的 15 年職業生涯中，我如何對待那些重組公司，我會告訴你，我的表現大約是硬幣擲出來的機率。大約一半時間我能戰勝市場，另一半時間市場擊敗了我。而這對我來說並不是一個很好的魚塘。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Mike: I actually think that’s quite important. There’s a great tradition in value investing of being good writers. I think writing forces you to slow down and think carefully about your thesis and how tight it is. I don’t know if you agree with that.<p>\n    <p>Chase: I absolutely agree.<p>\n    <p>Mike: And the other question I’d love to follow up on is: Have you noticed any interesting patterns? Like, do you buy too soon, buy too late, sell too soon, sell too late? Or are there any sizing issues? Are there behaviors you've observed that help you get better going forward?<p>\n    <p>Will: I’ll speak to this a bit, just to emphasize Chase’s point about Ruane, Kniff being a writing culture. We document our research from the first call to the last, so we have an internal research system where memos are constantly coming in from our analysts. I remember a third party recently called us, trying to sell us their services, saying, “We have over 10,000 transcripts from different calls, and you should subscribe to our service because look at the body of work you’ll have access to.” And I said, “You're not even close to what we have internally. Call me when you're bigger than we are in terms of your internal database.”<p>\n    <p>We have documented research on thousands of companies here, and all of that research has a date and a stock price associated with it. We can go back and see—not just on trading decisions, but at every single step of the research process—where we were, what we were thinking. It’s all in writing. It’s an invaluable resource.<p>\n    <p>And I think that through the introspection and retrospection we regularly do, it’s what has guided Will and me towards the kind of companies we like today. So, if you ask me personally how I’ve fared with, say, turnarounds over the course of my 15-year career, I’d tell you that I’m about a coin flip. Half the time I beat the market, and half the time the market beats me. And it’s not a very good pond for me to be fishing in.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"rcgs-writing-and-research-culture-2825\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#rcgs-writing-and-research-culture-2825\" aria-label=\"rcgs writing and research culture 2825 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>RCG’s writing and research culture (28:25)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Will: 所以，你需要認識到這一點並保持自我意識。Hyperion 投資的公司類型正是因為我們在這些公司上表現得非常好，我們可以詳細談談這些。所有這一切都是來自專注於哪些對你有效，並且在結果上保持一定的實證主義，努力不自欺。<p>\n    <p>Mike: 這是一個很好的過渡到下一個問題。我知道你們已經形容自己是商業分析師，並且喜歡從長期的盈餘能力來思考公司，但理想的 Hyperion 投資是什麼？你們在尋找一家企業時會考慮什麼？你們在尋找一隻股票時會考慮什麼？對你們來說，理想的投資是什麼？<p>\n    David: 我來說說理想的 Hyperion 投資。我可以用我們目前的一些持倉來說明。理想的投資應該是擁有超快的有機增長和未來發展空間的公司——像 Facebook 這樣的公司——具備像 Constellation Software 這樣的併購能力和紀律，擁有像 UnitedHealth 這樣的經濟衰退抗性，並且由像 Gilles Martin 這樣的創始人主導且是主要股東，像 Eurofins 的情況。我們希望它的估值較低，比如 Credit Acceptance，該公司通過在過去十年回購了 40% 的流通股來利用其始終保持低估值的優勢。所以，這基本上是一個包含所有這些特徵的理想投資模型，這些特徵在我們的投資組合中都有體現，但同時也保持平衡。如果我們真的找到了擁有所有這些特徵的公司，我們會奔跑而不是走路。<p>\n    <p>Will: 你可以看出我為什麼這麼喜歡和 Will 一起合作——他不僅僅是在說理想投資，還巧妙地把我們投資組合的一半融入其中。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Will: So, you need to recognize that and be self-aware. One of the things that's led Hyperion into the kind of companies it invests in is that we've done really well with these kinds of companies, and we can get into that. But all of this comes from focusing on what's worked for you and being a bit of an empiricist about your results, trying not to fool yourself.<p>\n    <p>Mike: Great segue to the next question. I know you guys already described yourselves as business analysts and that you like to think about the long-term earnings power of businesses, but what is an ideal Hyperion investment? What are you looking for in a firm, and what are you looking for in a stock? What would be the dream investment for you?<p>\n    <p>David: I’ll start with the ideal Hyperion investment. I can use some of our current holdings to illustrate. The ideal investment would be something with super fast organic growth and runway ahead of it—something like Facebook—with the M&A prowess and discipline of a company like Constellation Software, recession resilience like UnitedHealth, and run by a founder who is a major owner and operator, like Gilles Martin of Eurofins. We want it to trade for a low valuation, like Credit Acceptance, which has been taking advantage of its consistently low valuation by repurchasing 40% of its shares outstanding over the last 10 years. So it’s sort of a chimera of all those things, and all those attributes are represented in our portfolio, but balanced with other things.

We like companies with readily identifiable advantages, firms that are the best at what they do or unique in what they do. We like firms that have demonstrated differentiated products for their customers, which is usually indicated by market share gains. We like to say we like market share gainers, but we also prefer that they be gaining faster than anyone else in their industry. We like smart and aligned managers, and that usually means significant ownership in the businesses. So, we do have a bias in favor of founder-owners, typically. And like many others, we like conservative balance sheets. We like businesses that are resilient and are financed to withstand a storm.<p>\n    <p>Mike: Do you have any type of structure or quantitative filter that helps you narrow down companies that at least meet certain criteria—what could be considered an ideal Hyperion investment?<p>\n    <p>David: We all keep different lists. Chase is sort of the keeper of the list of companies that are run by founder-owner managers, and he tracks that very closely. Everybody knows that if they’re looking for a new project like that, they can go to him and see what’s next on the list if we haven’t covered something already. I keep a spreadsheet of fast-growing SaaS companies, and I have it organized by the growth rate, then the valuation (usually price to sales), and then some other different metrics. We all keep different lists, and each of the analysts is usually looking in specific areas. We’ve got 25 full-time analysts who are deep in this kind of work.

It’s probably not a very satisfying answer when someone asks us, “Where do you get your ideas?” and we answer, “We get them from everywhere,” but we’re really blessed. We have 25 fanatics combing the markets every day for opportunities for us to invest in. With that level of resources, you can really cover the waterfront. So we really do get them from everywhere. And while we have our personal biases and inclinations for what we like, we think it’s important to play more than one note. The firm philosophy is to play more than one note and invest in more than one type of company. Opportunity can come from a variety of different places, so we are willing to look at a lot of very different sorts of companies. We don’t want to just focus on one specific niche.<p>\n    <p>Mike: When you guys are thinking about how you sort businesses, there are a couple of empirical observations that we can make. One is that investors, by and large, overestimate growth for businesses. So, while we are all looking for growth businesses, the challenge is that often they don’t grow as much as people think or what’s priced in. Second, as we also know, M&A is really a hard way to create value. At least empirically, most deals don’t add value. Those are your number one or two criteria. So how do you sort those companies you believe will achieve the growth or do better than what the market anticipates? And how do you find those executives—those founder-executives—who really are the great capital allocators who know how to do deals that add value versus ones that are neutral or even value-destroying?<p>\n    <p>Chase: Like I was saying earlier, there are no shortcuts. It’s just turning over every rock. We place a lot of emphasis on scuttlebutt, getting a 360-degree view of a company by talking to competitors, suppliers, customers, ex-employees to really understand the nature of the beast, its market position, and what its likely future trajectory is. And of course, we don’t always get it right, especially in the cases where there’s fast growth, but we’ve been at it for a long time, and we are constantly trying to hone our ability to predict that. The same goes for capital allocation. We investigate what the track record has been. We go through that same diligence, talking to people who have been involved in the deals—whether as sellers, brokers, customers, or employees who have been through the integration process. And we try to understand if the rationale for the deal makes sense, whether the executives are really thinking about it the right way, because you can have a good track record sort of incidentally, without actually thinking about returns and risks the way that we would want them to think about it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"how-hyperion-tackles-due-diligence-3504\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-hyperion-tackles-due-diligence-3504\" aria-label=\"how hyperion tackles due diligence 3504 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How Hyperion tackles due diligence (35:04)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>David: 所以我們花了大量時間確認細節，確保對它有清晰的了解。我認為，在那些能創造價值的併購中，有一些持續存在的模式。你可以看看伯克希爾·哈撒韋（Berkshire Hathaway），等到沃倫·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）出名 20 年後，你就能夠預測他下一次的併購，從大概率來看，比較有可能創造價值，而不是毀壞價值，畢竟你談論的是沃倫·巴菲特。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 你可以看看市場，這些卓越的經理人無處不在，而且他們很容易辨識——他們會舉手。我們並不擁有所有這些公司，但無論是談到康斯達林軟體（Mark Leonard at Constellation Software），還是歐洲科學（Gilles Martin at Eurofins Scientific），這些公司你不需要在第一輪、第二輪或第三輪取得雙倍回報。你不需要在公司進行首十次收購或十二次收購時就介入。你可以等到看到這些公司已經有幾十年的成熟歷程，然後再決定是否投入資本。<p>\n    <p>David: 還有一些人在這方面定期進行操作——比如 SS&C 的 Bill Stone、Alimentation Couchetard 的 Alain Bouchard、CGI 的 Serge Godin 等等。所以我們會持續關注這些人和這些公司。雖然它們的估值有時候對我們來說不夠吸引人，但它們依然是我們感興趣的地方，因為這些經理人一直在穩定地創造價值。在很多情況下，收購的規模足夠小，即便有一個不成功的收購，也不會毀掉整筆投資。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 其實，更具體地說，我們在評估的時候，主要是在評估這個過程。我們確實是想弄清楚管理層怎麼思考這些事，如何尋找並整合收購標的。就像我們把他們當作我們資本的外包管理者一樣。我們想要了解他們的投資理念和方法。我們會稍後詳細討論幾個具體的案例，但在那之前，我很想簡要談談你們如何看待估值問題，尤其是關於如何評估無形資產的問題。這無疑是當下學術界和業界非常熱議的話題，對於你們正在尋找的這類公司來說，這也非常相關。所以你們一般是如何評估企業價值的，然後如何考慮無形資產的投資？這些無形資產通常會被列為費用，這對盈利有害，但長期來看可能會創造巨大的價值。<p>\n    <p>David: 我們專注於內在的盈利能力。我們試圖了解正常化後的盈利能力，這樣才能理解我們在某一時刻支付的價格。然後，我們會進行大量工作來理解這些盈利未來一段時間內的發展趨勢。因為歸根結底，這就是老話說的，對吧？公司的價值是折現的現金流，這就是最終能帶來的回報。它可能不是有形或無形的資產，而是這些資產所產生的現金流。因此，我們花了大量時間試圖了解企業的性質，無論它是有形的還是無形的。我們將投資視為過去人們會把資本化投資的方式來看待。我們的確會尋求識別那些在損益表中列為費用的投資。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>David: So we just spend a lot of time crossing our Ts and dotting our Is to make sure that we have a feel for it. I think there are some persistent patterns among the subset of mergers and acquisitions that do create value. You can look at Berkshire Hathaway 20 years after Warren Buffett became famous, and you’d probably be able to predict that his next acquisition was more likely to be value-creating than value-destroying, given that you're talking about Warren Buffett.<p>\n    <p>Chase: And you can look at the market, and these exceptional managers exist everywhere, and they're readily identifiable—they raise their hands. We don’t own all of them, but whether you're talking about Mark Leonard at Constellation Software or Gilles Martin at Eurofins Scientific, those are businesses where you don’t have to catch the first double or the second double or the third double. You don’t have to catch the business in its first 10 acquisitions or its first dozen. You can wait and see a demonstrated track record over sometimes decades before committing capital.<p>\n    <p>David: And there are players out there doing this on a regular basis—Bill Stone at SS&C, Alain Bouchard at Alimentation Couchetard, Serge Godin at CGI, among others. So we keep an eye on these people and these businesses. They don’t always trade for valuations that are attractive enough for us to invest, but they are interesting places to look because value is being created by these managers on a consistent basis. In a lot of cases, the acquisitions are small enough that one bad acquisition won’t kill the investment.<p>\n    <p>Chase: I mean, to put a finer point on it, we’re trying to evaluate the process. We’re really trying to get at exactly how management is thinking about it, how they source it, how they go about integrating it. It’s the same way that we think of them as outsourced managers of our capital. We want to understand their investment philosophy and approach. We'll talk about a couple of names in more detail in just a moment, but before we get to that, I’d love to just talk briefly about how you guys think about valuations or what the core principles are there, and in particular, an emphasis on how you value intangibles. This is obviously a very hot topic now in both the academic and practitioner community, clearly very relevant for the types of businesses that you’re looking at. So how do you guys value businesses in general, and then how do you take into consideration intangible investments, which, by the way, are often expensed, which are deleterious to earnings, but may actually create a lot of value in the long run?<p>\n    <p>David: We’re focused on intrinsic earnings power. We’re trying to understand what is the normalized earnings power in order to understand what we’re paying at any given moment. Then we do a lot of work to try to understand what the trajectory of those earnings will be over time. Because at the end of the day, that’s the old saw, right? The value of the firm is the discounted cash flows, and that’s what you can eat at the end of the day. It may not be the tangible or the intangible assets—it’s what they throw off. And so we spend a lot of time trying to understand the nature of the franchise, whether it's tangible or intangible. We think of investments in the same way people would think about capitalized investments in the past. We do seek to recognize investments that are expensed through the P&L as well.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"focusing-on-intrinsic-earnings-power-3856\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#focusing-on-intrinsic-earnings-power-3856\" aria-label=\"focusing on intrinsic earnings power 3856 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Focusing on intrinsic earnings power (38:56)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>David: 在過去十年裡，我認為有很多機會，投資於那些在成長飛輪上大幅投資，但並未報告顯著的 GAAP 盈利的企業。其中最突出的當然是亞馬遜（Amazon），你們也知道，我們曾經是亞馬遜的投資者。我們花了很長時間才對那家公司的內在盈利能力有了清晰的估算，因為它是一個非常複雜的公司。為我們覆蓋亞馬遜的分析師打過數百次電話，當這個項目結束時，我覺得他對亞馬遜的利潤率了解比大多數在那裡工作的員工還要多，因為亞馬遜內部的資訊非常封閉，員工能接觸到的資料是非常有限的。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 我們在這個案子上做了很多工作，就當作一個案例來看。我們從後向前推算，識別出由於成長投資造成的損失，然後把它們分開，說：“好吧，這是我們能夠識別出來的，這是他們在這些投資上花了多少億美元。” 這是我們推算其真實盈利能力的一種方法。因此，當我們購入亞馬遜股票時，我們認為我們是在以 30 倍的倍數支付當時的真實盈利能力。而當然，亞馬遜的增長是飛速的。所以對我們來說，它是一個非常有吸引力的投資。這花了我們大量的工作。因此，正如 Will 所說，這真的沒有捷徑。<p>\n    David: 在我們進入這幾個具體案例之前，還有一個問題我想問，這是所有優秀資產管理實踐的基礎之一。這是資產管理領域中最神秘的問題之一，也是我們在課堂上經常被問到的問題，然而我們沒有很精確的答案，那就是：你們如何決定投資的規模，並將多樣化的需求納入投資組合建構中？行業集中度的問題，專業化和多樣化之間的取捨，當然，這些問題也非常重要。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>David: There’ve been a lot of opportunities, I think, over the last decade, investing in businesses that were investing significantly in growing their flywheel without reporting significant GAAP earnings. The most prominent among these was Amazon, as you know, and we were investors in Amazon. It took us a long time to get comfortable with our estimate of that company’s intrinsic earnings power because it’s a complicated beast. The analyst who covered Amazon for us did calls in the triple digits, and by the time that project was finished, I think he knew more about the margins of Amazon than most of the employees who worked there because it was very siloed in terms of the availability of information internally to the employees of Amazon themselves.<p>\n    <p>Chase: And we sort of set on that one, just to take a case study. We worked backwards, we identified losses from growth investments, and we put them aside and said, “Alright, here’s what we’ve been able to identify. Here’s how many billions of dollars they’re spending on it.” And that was one approach to triangulating their true earnings power. So when we purchased Amazon, we thought we were paying 30 times their true earnings power at the time. And of course, it was growing like a weed. So it was a very, very compelling investment for us. It took a lot of work. So as Will said, there’s just no shortcuts.<p>\n    <p>David: Before we move to those couple of names, there’s another question that I want to ask about these founding tools of any good asset management practice. It’s one of the most mysterious in asset management and one that we get asked often in the classroom, for which we have little intense answers, which is this issue: How do you size your positions and incorporate diversification motives into your portfolio construction? Issues of industry concentration, trading off the issues of specialization and diversification, of course, is an important issue as well.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-portfolio-construction-4146\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-art-of-portfolio-construction-4146\" aria-label=\"the art of portfolio construction 4146 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The art of portfolio construction (41:46)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase: 那麼，能不能告訴我們一下 Hyperion 在投資組合建構方面的過程？<p>\n    <p>David: 對我們來說，這更多是一門藝術而非科學，且我們有意為之。在 Hyperion，我們當然會保持對各項投資中共通因素的警覺。我們希望確保自己所承擔的任何風險是有意識的，而非無意的。我們的投資涵蓋了 11 個不同的行業，其中有兩項投資——谷歌和 Facebook，它們都受益於線上廣告，並且面臨一些相同的風險，包括聯邦機構對其壟斷權力的審查。因此，雖然我們意識到投資組合中的共通驅動因素，但我們並不會過於科學化地處理這個問題。這更多是依靠常識和直覺。在投資規模的安排上，我們會將我們有較高信心的投資規模做得比那些回報可能相同或更高，但變數和潛在結果也較大的投資規模做得大。我們會考量風險調整後的回報，並根據我們的信心以及對業務的理解來進行規模安排。<p>\n    <p>Will: 你會補充什麼嗎？<p>\n    <p>David: 是的，在規模安排上，Chase 和我會保持對各個股票的預期內部報酬率（IRR）進行跟蹤。我們可以將這些投資進行排序，並根據排序來安排投資組合的規模。但顯然，這樣做會顯得太簡單，因為所有這些投資中都包含了風險，而且我們信任某些管理者能在回報上給我們帶來更多的驚喜，或者能更好地管理我們的資本。這些並不總是能在預期的 IRR 中體現出來，而我們希望能夠將它們納入其中。因此，我們會有一些額外的調整——或者對我而言，會有不同的排序，這些排序是基於我對管理團隊資本配置能力的信任，還有企業的韌性以及其他一些我們認為與數字一樣重要的質性因素，比如預期增長以及它如何轉化為回報，儘管這些因素不太容易量化。<p>\n    <p>Chase: 在了解企業盈利能力的發展路徑和投資組合建構的過程中，你們會運行不同的情境嗎？你們會說，這家公司今天在這裡，如果順利，它可能會達到 X。如果情況不好，它可能會跌到 Y 嗎？對於情境的思考和你們會處於哪些情境之中，有何看法？<p>\n    <p>David: 分析師們通常會運行幾個不同的情境。我不確定這是不是像你所說的那樣正式，但對我們來說，這並不是一個正式化的過程。通常，分析師會說：“這是我對這項投資的預期回報，這是最好的情況，藍天情境下的結果。如果我錯了，情況會怎麼樣，這是我可能錯誤的地方。”我們會以啟發式的方式進行，而非正式化地處理，Mike，我會這麼說。<p>\n    <p>Will: 我曾經參加過一些這樣的預測性失敗練習，這些練習從某種角度來說是相當有趣的。你會學到很多東西，當你在思考一些荒謬的情境時，總會有某個人會說，“這種情況在那個行業，或者那個國家曾經發生過，”突然之間，你會重新調整對特定情境的可能性評估，儘管它們看起來不太可能。令人驚訝的是，極端風險往往會回過頭來傷害你。那些你認為不太可能的情境，實際上比你想象的更有可能發生。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase: So why don’t you tell us a little bit about your process inside Hyperion for portfolio construction?<p>\n    <p>David: It’s very much an art rather than a science for us, and intentionally so. Within Hyperion, we maintain awareness, obviously, of common factors across our investments. We want to make sure that any risks we’re taking on in that respect aren’t unintentional. We have a dozen different investments in 11 different industries. The two investments that really have a common driving factor are Google and Facebook, which are both driven by online advertising and subject to some of the same risks, including the scrutiny they’re getting by federal authorities for monopoly power. So, while we are aware of the common drivers among the portfolio investments, we’re not pseudoscientific about it. It’s about using common sense and intuition. When it comes to sizing, we do size those positions where we have higher conviction, bigger than investments where we might think the returns are just as good or higher, but the variability and potential outcome are higher as well. We look at risk-adjusted return and our conviction and ability to understand the business when considering sizing.<p>\n    <p>Will: What would you add to that?<p>\n    <p>David: Yeah, when it comes to sizing, Chase and I, we maintain our view on prospective IRRs for the various stocks that we’re considering for the portfolio. You could just rank those and size the portfolio accordingly. But obviously, that would be a naive way to do it because there are risks embedded in all these, and there are certain managers we trust to surprise us on the upside more than others or steward our capital better more than others. That’s not always built into the prospective IRR as much as we would like to incorporate it. As such, we have overlays—or personally, I do—just different rankings for how much I trust the management team to allocate capital well, and then how resilient the business is and various other qualitative factors that we think are just as important as the quantitative ones, like what’s the prospective growth and how does that translate into return, just not as easily quantifiable.<p>\n    <p>Chase: And just relating to understanding the path of the earnings power of the business and also for portfolio construction, do you guys run scenarios? Do you say, this business is here today, if it goes well, it could be X. If it goes poorly, it could go to Y? What’s your thinking about scenarios and where you might be in that set of scenarios?<p>\n    <p>David: The analysts will usually run a few different scenarios. I don’t know if it’s as formal as the way you phrased it implies, but it’s not a formalized process for us. Very commonly, analysts will say, “Here’s my expected return on the investment. Here’s what could happen in the best case, the blue sky scenario. Here’s what could happen if I’m wrong. And here’s where I’m likely to be wrong.” We do it heuristically, Mike, I would say, rather than formally.<p>\n    <p>Will: I’ve been in some of these pre-mortem exercises, and they’re quite interesting in a way. You learn a lot thinking through some wild scenarios, and there’s someone always in the room who says, “Oh, that happened here and there in that industry, in that country,” and all of a sudden, you reweight your probabilities of particular scenarios, unlikely as they may be. It’s amazing how often tail risks will come back to bite you. Scenarios that you consider unlikely turn out to be less unlikely than you think.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"running-scenarios-on-potential-investments-4405\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#running-scenarios-on-potential-investments-4405\" aria-label=\"running scenarios on potential investments 4405 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Running scenarios on potential investments (44:05)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase: 是的，完全同意。投資組合建構這個話題值得特別強調。我認為這對學生或者剛入行的人來說是有啟發的。過去我觀察到的一個問題是，很多進入這行的人希望模仿他們的偶像。他們想模仿沃倫·巴菲特，或者模仿 Joel Greenblatt。集中投資的問題在於，對於一個人來說的正確答案，對另一個人來說可能並不適用。這真的取決於你的優勢是什麼，適當的多樣化程度對於不同的人來說是不同的，甚至在不同的公司和不同的時間點也會有所不同。<p>\n    <p>Chase (續)：如果你看看 Sequoia 基金在80年代，我們的投資組合裡通常只有單數個股票。首先，那時的競爭環境不一樣，其次，我們當時並沒有今天這麼強大的研究資源。所以今天，Sequoia 基金大概有25隻股票的投資組合，而這對於當下的情況來說是合適的。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase: Yeah, absolutely. The topic of portfolio construction is worth highlighting. I think there's something to be said for students or people who are new to the business. It's an issue I’ve observed with young portfolio managers in the past. A lot of folks getting into this business want to emulate their idols. They want to emulate Warren Buffett or they want to emulate Joel Greenblatt. The problem with concentration is that the right answer for one person is not the right answer for another person. It really depends on what your edge is, and the appropriate level of diversification is different for different people. It’s even different for different firms across time.<p>\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): If you look at Sequoia Fund in the '80s, we often ran with a single-digit number of stocks in the portfolio. It was a different level of competition back then, number one. And number two, we didn’t have the research resources we have today. So, today, Sequoia runs with about 25 stocks in the portfolio, and that feels appropriate for the time.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-with-portfolio-managers-emulating-their-idols-4511\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-problem-with-portfolio-managers-emulating-their-idols-4511\" aria-label=\"the problem with portfolio managers emulating their idols 4511 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The problem with portfolio managers emulating their idols (45:11)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase (續)：我不喜歡看到年輕的第一年投資經理模仿沃倫·巴菲特，將自己的投資組合高度集中，或者模仿 Joel Greenblatt，擁有五隻股票，這樣做的前提是他們並沒有像巴菲特當年投資美國運通時那樣的優勢，或者像 Greenblatt 在80年代投資分拆公司時那樣的優勢。這真的是每個經理的個別答案，這取決於你能帶來的優勢是什麼。<p>\n    <p>Chase (續)：這確實是一個很好的觀點。你的研究能力與研究資源之間的關係，以及在多樣化方面你能承擔的程度，這確實是關鍵，也是通常被忽視的要點。能否請你們談談之前提到的一些公司，並且看看我們是否可以將一些想法應用於這些公司上？例如 Will 提到的 Constellation Software。首先，能否為我們的聽眾解釋一下「收購整合」是什麼，以及投資這樣的公司會面臨哪些挑戰？<p>\n    <p>Chase：所以，「收購整合」是指一家公司在特定領域內進行大量收購，將該行業中的業務整合在一起。在 Constellation Software 的例子中，它是由 Mark Leonard 於1995年在加拿大創立的，旨在投資垂直市場軟體公司並整合該行業，可以說它是在進行「收購整合」。他在這方面建立了卓越的業績記錄，但並非所有的收購整合都會有好結果。很多來自60年代和70年代的企業集團或收購整合公司最終以悲劇告終。<p>\n    <p>Chase (續)：總是有很多收購整合的案例圍繞著我們，其中有一些會做得很好——它們會保持紀律，不會過度擴張，能夠很好地整合業務，也不會過度支付。然而，也有一些公司是在過度支付，儘管在增長，但卻在摧毀價值。關鍵是要理解這些公司之間的區別，我們認為這最終取決於調查過程。該公司是否有健全的過程？</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): What I don’t like to see is young, first-year portfolio managers emulating Warren Buffett by being hyper-concentrated in their portfolios or emulating Joel Greenblatt by owning five stocks when they don’t have the same level of advantage that Buffett did when he was investing in American Express after the salad oil scandal, or when Greenblatt was investing in spinoffs in the '80s. It really is an individual answer for each different manager. It depends on what advantage you bring to the table.<p>\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): That’s actually a wonderful comment. The relation between your research capability and your research power, and what you can afford in terms of diversification, is absolutely key and a point that is typically missed. Can I suggest we move to a couple of the names you guys have mentioned and whether we can project some of the ideas onto those names? So, one that Will brought up is Constellation Software. Can you describe first for our listeners what a roll-up is and the challenges that come with investing in such a company?<p>\n    <p>Chase: So, a roll-up is a common term for a company that makes a lot of acquisitions in a particular field, consolidating businesses in that industry. In the case of Constellation Software, it was founded in 1995 by Mark Leonard in Canada to invest in vertical market software companies and roll up that industry, if you want to call it that. He preferred to call it a conglomerate. He has built a tremendous track record doing this, but not all roll-ups end happily. There are many conglomerates or roll-ups from the '60s and '70s that ended in tears.<p>\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): It’s always the case that there are roll-ups happening all around us, and some of them will do well—they’ll be disciplined, and they won’t overextend themselves. They’ll integrate things well, and they won’t overpay. But there are others that are overpaying, growing, but destroying value. The key is to try to understand the distinction between these, and we think it comes down to investigating the process. Does the company have a sound process?</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-roll-ups-4715\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#understanding-roll-ups-4715\" aria-label=\"understanding roll ups 4715 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Understanding roll-ups (47:15)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase (續)：他們是否將這些投資視為不僅僅是增長和擴展的手段，而是將資本投資於高回報且成功機率高的項目？另外，你還必須注意的是激勵機制。一個好的過程，加上確保負責收購整合的管理者並不是只想通過股東的資金來搞快速致富計劃或進行不良收購，而是將其視為自己的錢來處理。這也是為什麼我們偏好那些由創始人擁有並且是運營者的情況，這樣的人通常從一開始就參與公司，擁有相當大的股份，並會將你的錢和他們的錢一起投資——真正地視這些錢為他們自己的。<p>\n    <p>Chase (續)：Will，你能談談為什麼垂直軟體行業適合進行整合嗎？<p>\n    <p>Will：這個行業極其分散。想一想，幾乎所有的商業或組織，都需要一些軟體來進行行政管理，通常這些軟體都是定制的。他們不僅僅是想在紙面或 Excel 上運行操作。所以，市場上有很多小型軟體公司提供專門的解決方案來管理各行各業的需求，像是健身房、高爾夫俱樂部、市政府、非營利組織、圖書館——實際上任何組織或商業活動，可能都需要這些專門的軟體。這些需求在不同地區也有所不同。例如，可能有一家荷蘭公司提供藥房軟體，幫助全科醫生和藥房之間處理處方。因此，Consolidation就在這些企業中進行收購。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): Do they think about these investments as not purely just growth and accretion, but also investing capital at a high rate of return with a high probability of success? Another thing you have to keep in mind is incentives. A good process, plus ensuring that whoever’s managing the roll-up isn’t just trying to run a get-rich-quick scheme or make bad acquisitions with shareholder money, but feels that this is really their own money. That’s why we prefer situations where there’s a founder-owner-operator in charge, someone who has been involved with the business from the start, has a significant stake in it, and will invest your money alongside theirs—really considering it their own.<p>\n    <p>Chase (cont’d): Will, can you discuss why the vertical software industry is appropriate for consolidation?<p>\n    <p>Will: It's extremely fragmented. Think of any business or organization out there, really. To keep things in order administratively, they need software, often customized. They don’t just want to run it on paper or Excel. So, there are many small software businesses providing specialized solutions to manage various industries like fitness gyms, golf clubs, municipalities, nonprofit organizations, libraries—really any organization or business endeavor. They probably rely on specialized software. This also differs by geography. For example, there might be a Dutch company that provides pharmacy software to process prescriptions between GPs and pharmacies. So, Constellation is out there acquiring these businesses.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"why-the-vertical-software-industry-is-well-suited-to-consolidation-4927\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-the-vertical-software-industry-is-well-suited-to-consolidation-4927\" aria-label=\"why the vertical software industry is well suited to consolidation 4927 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why the vertical software industry is well-suited to consolidation (49:27)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Will (續)：這個行業的一個奇妙之處，不僅是其分散性，還有這些軟體解決方案的粘性。這些系統對於使用它們的組織來說通常是關鍵任務，沒有什麼比更換新系統並重新訓練整個員工隊伍更令他們頭疼的了。因此，當你在這個行業中收購到合適的軟體時，它有很強的持久性。衰退曲線通常是可預測的，如果你做出正確的投資，你可以很好地維護這個品牌。這種分散性意味著市場上有很多小型公司。Consolidation已經建立了最好的機制來收購這些小型軟體公司，通常是從創始人或他們的家族手中以公正的價格收購。<p>\n    <p>Preston Pyshko：為了深入了解一下，這些賣家顯然在將公司賣給Consolidation Software時，希望能最大化他們公司的價值。那麼，Consolidation究竟是怎麼做到從他們為這些收購所支付的價格中創造或建立價值的呢？我們知道最成功的整合收購通常有一個具體的公式。那麼，他們做了哪些特定的事情來為這些被收購的公司增值呢？<p>\n    <p>Chase：他們確實有一套收購後提升業務的操作手冊。但在我們進入這些細節之前，Consolidation會告訴你，他們投資回報率（IRR）的關鍵在於他們為每項收購支付的價格。一切都從價格開始。他們不斷與成千上萬的小公司保持聯繫，通過他們的Salesforce數據庫，持續聯繫，了解這些公司是否準備好出售——更重要的是，這些公司是否準備好以Consolidation能夠實現回報的合理價格出售。<p>\n    <p>你會驚訝地發現，這些小公司通常沒有太多的買家。許多公司存在問題——它們通常由單一業主運營，並未最大化公司價值，或者可能擁有過於集中的客戶群，這讓其他買家對失去大客戶的風險感到擔憂。但Consolidation擁有數百家這樣的企業，每年收購超過100家。他們能夠“玩統計”，這意味著他們經常能夠單獨來源獲得交易。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Will (cont’d): One of the wonderful things about this industry is not only the fragmentation but how sticky these software solutions are. These systems are often mission-critical for the organizations using them, and there's nothing they’d like less than switching to a new system and retraining their entire staff. So, when you purchase the right software in this industry, it has staying power. The decline curves are typically predictable, and if you make the right investments, you can maintain that franchise quite well. The fragmentation means there are a lot of smaller companies out there. Constellation has built the best machine to acquire these little software companies, usually buying them from the founders or their families for a fair price.<p>\n    <p>Preston Pyshko: Just to get into the weeds a bit, these sellers are obviously trying to maximize the value of their business when they sell to Constellation Software. What exactly is the formula that Constellation uses to create or build value from the price they pay for these acquisitions? We know that the best roll-ups tend to have a specific formula. Are there particular elements of what they do to add value once the business is in their fold?<p>\n    <p>Chase: They absolutely have a playbook for improving businesses after they acquire them. But before we get into that, what Constellation would tell you is that the key to their return on investment—the IRR from any acquisition—is the price they pay. It all starts with the price. They are constantly in touch with tens of thousands of small companies through their Salesforce database, consistently reaching out to gauge if these companies are ready to sell—and more importantly, if they’re ready to sell at the right price for Constellation to make their return.<p>\n    <p>You’d be surprised, these small businesses don’t often have a lot of suitors. Many have issues—they’re often run by sole proprietors who haven’t maximized the business’s value or may have an undiversified customer base, which makes other buyers nervous about the risk of losing a large customer. But Constellation has hundreds of these businesses and acquires over 100 per year. They can afford to play the averages, which means they often can sole-source deals.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"where-constellation-software-focuses-on-making-their-return-5159\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#where-constellation-software-focuses-on-making-their-return-5159\" aria-label=\"where constellation software focuses on making their return 5159 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where Constellation Software focuses on making their return (51:59)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase：關於Consolidation Software，值得注意的是，除了是一個收購機器之外，他們還會思考他們收購的企業之間可能的協同效應。他們可能會將服務捆綁在一起，提供給客戶包裝方案，創造出一些之前可能沒有意識到的價值。但我也想知道，在某些收購中，是否有些是出於防禦性動機。例如，一個企業可能會看到來自尚未擁有的競爭對手的潛在威脅，因此，預防性地收購它可能是一個策略性的舉措。最近有很多關於“致命收購”（killer acquisitions）的討論，即通過收購一家企業來消除潛在威脅。這類收購的價格可能會被推高，因為賣方知道他們擁有籌碼——如果你不收購它們，它們可能會干擾你的利潤，並分散你的市場注意力。<p>\n    <p>Consolidation進行的收購類型有很多變化。真正的問題是，他們如何將這些收購整合進現有的投資組合中，而不會受到“維度詛咒”的困擾，即擁有過多的企業會使得追蹤集團的運營變得困難。<p>\n    <p>Preston Pyshko：所以，Consolidation確實會進行一些帶有防禦策略的收購，而且他們對此很坦率。但他們如何評估這些類型的收購呢？他們又是如何管理自己的投資組合，以避免被擁有大量企業所壓垮？<p>\n    <p>Chase：他們有自己的一套收購評估框架，包括防禦性的收購。值得注意的是，Consolidation發現他們的收購往往是由於他們所收購的軟體解決方案的粘性。這些軟體解決方案對於他們的客戶業務運作至關重要，而客戶在更換軟體時非常不願意，甚至當軟體已經過時。<p>\n    <p>有時候，這些軟體解決方案的某些組件已經接近生命周期結束，但客戶仍然不願意升級，因為這會涉及大量的努力。這種情況有時會變成一種“遺留陷阱”（legacy trap），客戶會堅持使用一個已經過時的解決方案，遠超過它的最佳使用期限。Consolidation已經學會如何識別這些情況並加以利用。如果客戶即將被迫從舊有解決方案中切換，Consolidation就能趁機收購一個更新的、基於雲端的版本的軟體。然後，他們可以將這個新解決方案作為舊客戶的升級路徑，從而確保過渡過程無縫，並且讓遺留客戶依然留在Consolidation的生態系統中。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase: What's interesting about Constellation Software is that, in addition to being an acquisition machine, they also think about the possible synergies between the businesses they acquire. They might bundle services and offer packages to clients, creating value they might not have been aware of before. But I also wonder to what extent some acquisitions are driven by defensive motives. For instance, a business might see a potential threat from a competitor they don’t own yet, so acquiring it preemptively might be a strategic move. There’s a lot of talk about “killer acquisitions” lately, where you acquire a company to eliminate a potential threat. The price for such an acquisition can be inflated because the seller knows they’re holding leverage—they can disrupt profits and distract your market if you don’t acquire them.<p>\n    <p>There’s a lot of variation in the types of acquisitions Constellation makes. The real question is how they integrate these acquisitions into their existing portfolio without suffering from the “curse of dimensionality,” where having too many businesses makes it difficult to track the conglomerate’s operations.<p>\n    <p>Preston Pyshko: So, Constellation does indeed make some acquisitions with a defensive strategy in mind, and they’re upfront about it. But how do they value those kinds of acquisitions? And how do they manage their portfolio to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer number of businesses they own?<p>\n    <p>Chase: They have their own framework for valuing acquisitions, including defensive ones. What’s interesting is that Constellation has found that their acquisitions are often driven by the stickiness of the software solutions they’re acquiring. These software solutions are often critical to their customers’ operations, and customers are very reluctant to switch, even when the software is outdated.<p>\n    <p>Sometimes, these software solutions have components that are nearing the end of their life cycle, but customers are still hesitant to upgrade because of the effort involved. The situation can sometimes be a bit of a “legacy trap,” where customers stick with a solution far past its prime. Constellation has learned to identify these situations and use them to their advantage. If a customer is about to be forced into switching away from an old solution, Constellation can swoop in and acquire a more modern, cloud-based version of the software. They can then offer this new solution as an upgrade path for the old customers, essentially ensuring that the transition is seamless and that the legacy customers stay within the Constellation ecosystem.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"constellation-softwares-framework-for-defensive-acquisitions-5415\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#constellation-softwares-framework-for-defensive-acquisitions-5415\" aria-label=\"constellation softwares framework for defensive acquisitions 5415 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Constellation Software’s framework for defensive acquisitions (54:15)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Chase：因此，Consolidation Software使用的收購策略能夠通過提供升級路徑來讓客戶保持滿意，而不會迫使他們立即切換。遺留客戶可能不願意立即更換，但當他們知道在適當的時候有一個現代化、最新的解決方案可供選擇時，這通常足以讓他們保持忠誠。他們最近的一些收購是SaaS公司，這很有趣。如今有如此多的風險資本在市場上，每一個成功的獨角獸背後，都有無數其他公司未能成功，儘管它們擁有出色的產品。Consolidation能以相對便宜的價格收購這些公司，並利用它們來增強他們的產品。<p>\n    <p>Trey Lockerbie：為了讓我們的聽眾了解，你能簡要介紹一下Consolidation Software的財務狀況嗎？預期的營收、盈利和增長，以及股市市值大致是多少？<p>\n    <p>David Collum：當然。Consolidation Software今年預計會產生約40億美元的收入，市值大約為360億美元。我們預計它將以中個位數的增長增長。讓我們喜歡這家公司的一點是，他們沒有發行任何新股，也沒有回購股票，所以很容易追蹤。該公司目前有21,191,530股流通股，這是你可以隨時記住的數字。根據他們未來的盈利能力，我們估計股票價格大約是1,700美元，每股盈利在40美元左右。這使得股票的市盈率約為30倍，預計增長在中到高個位數。<p>\n    <p>Stig Brodersen：Consolidation的運作真是令人著迷。當我們看這些以收購為驅動力的公司——如Teledyne、伯克希爾哈撒韋（Berkshire Hathaway）和丹納赫（Danaher）——時，理解它們成功背後的紀律非常重要。這些公司成功的關鍵往往在於它們能夠以結構化、戰略性的方法來執行收購。學習它們如何成功，能為建立一個成功的收購策略提供很好的見解。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Chase: So, with the acquisition strategy that Constellation Software uses, they manage to keep their customers happy by offering them an upgrade path without pushing them to switch immediately. The legacy customers might not want to switch, but knowing there’s a modern, up-to-date solution available for them when the time comes is often enough to keep them loyal. A lot of their more recent acquisitions have been SaaS companies, which is interesting. There's so much venture capital floating around these days, and for every successful unicorn, there are countless other companies that didn’t quite make it—despite having a great product. Constellation can scoop these up at a relatively cheap price and use them to enhance their offerings.<p>\n    <p>Trey Lockerbie: For our listeners, can you give us a brief rundown of Constellation Software’s financials—what kind of revenue, earnings, and growth you expect, and what the stock market cap looks like?<p>\n    <p>David Collum: Sure. Constellation Software is expecting to generate about $4 billion in revenue this year. The market cap is around $36 billion. We project that it will grow in the mid-teens. One of the things we like about the company is that they haven’t issued any new shares, nor have they bought any back, so it’s easy to track. There are 21,191,530 shares outstanding, so you can always keep that number in mind. Based on their future earnings power, we estimate the stock price to be about $1,700, with earnings in the low 40s per share. That puts the stock at just over 30 times earnings, with mid-to-high teens growth expected.<p>\n    <p>Stig Brodersen: It’s fascinating how Constellation operates. When we look at these acquisition-driven companies—like Teledyne, Berkshire Hathaway, and Danaher—it’s important to understand the discipline behind their success. The key to these businesses often lies in their ability to execute acquisitions with a structured, strategic approach. Studying how they succeed can provide great insights into building a successful acquisition strategy.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-know-about-constellation-software-5649\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-you-need-to-know-about-constellation-software-5649\" aria-label=\"what you need to know about constellation software 5649 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What you need to know about Constellation Software (56:49)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>Stig Brodersen: 這些高效能集團的迷人之處在於它們能夠長期有效地部署資本。有些公司能在數十年間規模化收購，當你發現一家擁有基礎設施來持續有效運作的公司時，你就找到了值得你投資的複利機器。深入挖掘這些公司，了解它們的運作方式，尤其是當公司由一位從創立之初就參與其中的創始人兼業主領導時，這樣的公司可能會是你長期持有的好選擇。<p>\n    <p>Chase Clymer: 完全同意。接下來聊聊另一家有趣的公司——Eurofins。Will，你想先說說這家公司嗎？我也想回到Consolidation，特別是關於Mark Leonard如何成功地實現了對收購決策的多樣化。<p>\n    <p>Will Pfeiffer: 當然，我先回答這個問題，然後我們再回來談Eurofins。關於Mark Leonard，一個經營大規模收購機構的挑戰在於如何在數百次收購中保持監督。如今，Consolidation大約在全球經營著近千家實體，每年進行數百宗收購。Mark Leonard的做法尤其獨特。他深入研究了其他高效能集團，如伯克希爾哈撒韋、丹納赫（Danaher）和Amatek，並從他們的經驗中學到了很多。<p>\n    <p>許多這類集團最終會隨著時間推進進行越來越大的收購。然而，隨著公司規模的擴大，因為來自其他戰略性玩家和私募股權的競爭加劇，進行大宗交易變得更加困難。Mark Leonard有意識地選擇了與眾不同的方式，繼續進行較小的收購，這在成功的集團中是相當罕見的。他選擇堅持小型交易，這讓他避免了與大型交易的激烈競爭，同時仍保持有效擴展的能力。<p>\n    <p>Chase Clymer: 這對Leonard的策略和他如何保持Consolidation優勢的見解真是很棒。不過，讓我們還是聊聊Eurofins，聽起來它是一家很有意思的公司。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Stig Brodersen: What's fascinating about these high-performance conglomerates is their ability to deploy capital over long periods. Some companies manage to scale acquisitions over decades, and when you find one that has the infrastructure to keep doing it effectively, you’ve found a compounding machine that’s worth your time. It's essential to dig deep into these companies and understand how they work, especially when there’s a founder-owner at the helm who’s been there from the beginning. This could be a business you want to stick with for the long haul.<p>\n    <p>Chase Clymer: Absolutely. Moving on to another interesting company—Eurofins. Will, would you like to dive into that? I’m also curious to circle back to Constellation, especially regarding how Mark Leonard has successfully diversified decision-making for their acquisitions.<p>\n    <p>Will Pfeiffer: Sure, I’ll take that question first and then we’ll get back to Eurofins. So, regarding Mark Leonard, one of the challenges in running a large acquisition machine is how to maintain oversight across hundreds of acquisitions. Constellation is now operating close to a thousand entities across the globe, making hundreds of acquisitions every year. Mark Leonard’s approach is particularly unique. He’s deeply studied other high-performance conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway, Danaher, and Amatek, and has learned from their experiences.<p>\n    <p>What many of these conglomerates end up doing is making larger and larger acquisitions over time. However, as companies grow, it becomes more difficult to make big deals because of increased competition from other strategic players and private equity. What Mark Leonard has consciously done differently is to continue making smaller acquisitions, something that’s quite rare among successful conglomerates. He’s chosen to stick with smaller deals, which allows him to avoid the intense competition for bigger deals while maintaining the ability to scale effectively.<p>\n    <p>Chase Clymer: That’s a great insight into Leonard's strategy and how he’s kept Constellation’s edge in making successful acquisitions. Let's move on to Eurofins, though, as it sounds like a fascinating company to explore.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mark-leonards-unique-approach-to-acquisitions-5853\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mark-leonards-unique-approach-to-acquisitions-5853\" aria-label=\"mark leonards unique approach to acquisitions 5853 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mark Leonard’s unique approach to acquisitions (58:53)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>我指的是，伯克希爾的一些部分仍然在進行小型交易。也許Marmon仍然在進行一些小於巴菲特在頂層做出的重大承諾的交易。但是，Consolidation每年投入的資本，大約5億美元用於收購，仍然大部分是由他所訓練的整個團隊進行的，這些交易通常是5百萬或1千萬美元的交易，他所開創的這個流程。因此，不只是他下面的六位運營組經理，他們與他一起工作已經有幾十年了，還有那些六位經理下面報告的六個或七個人，或者不管有多少人。再往下，這些就是進行交易的人，他們已經受過訓練，並且被賦予了這個責任，去進行有紀律的收購並照顧這些公司。這實際上是非常迷人的。那麼Eurofins，Chase，請告訴我們一些關於它的事情。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>I mean, there are parts of Berkshire that are still making small deals. Maybe Marmon is still making deals that are smaller than the sort of big commitments that Buffett is making up at the top. But the amount of capital that Constellation is deploying, $500 million a year on acquisitions, is mostly still being done in sort of $5, $10 million deals by this whole team that he's trained to run this process that he pioneered. And so it's not just the six operating group managers who are one level below him that have been with him for decades, but it's then the six people or six or seven folks or whoever, or whatever number report to those six folks. And then a level below that, those are the people that are making the deals and they've been sort of trained and inoculated and invested with this responsibility to go out and make disciplined acquisitions and care for these companies.

So I think a lot of listeners won't be familiar with Eurofins, so let me give you just a basic overview. Eurofins is a testing company that provides testing services to customers in the food, pharma, environmental, and clinical diagnostics markets. They offer every kind of test imaginable to ensure the quality, authenticity, purity, chemical makeup of their customer's product. And lately, that last vertical, clinical diagnostics, has taken on special importance because Eurofins has processed more than 25 million COVID tests since the start of that pandemic. It was certainly not a big business for them, obviously, prior to the pandemic. And it's one that we, like many others, are hopeful that the need for COVID testing declines sooner rather than later.<p>\n    <p>So Eurofins is a diversified testing company. And to give you a sense of its scale, they operate 900 labs in 50 countries, and they perform more than 450 million tests each year from a menu of more than 200,000 different tests. Incredibly, this company is only 34 years young and is still run by its founder, Gilles Martin, who is not yet two years old. So I guess the first question would be, how do you get a company of this scale in 34 short years when it was founded with four employees in a single lab in 1987? And the answer is he's done a lot of acquisitions.<p>\n    <p>And so I don't want to give listeners the impression that all Hyperion does is invest in roll-ups. It's only a minority of our portfolio. But Eurofins does rhyme with Constellation Software in this respect in that it has a brilliant capital allocator at the helm. And Gilles Martin has conducted more than 300 acquisitions over the life of the firm. And so what I think is important is if I describe to you the structure of the industry, you will probably come to your own conclusion that this is an industry that makes a lot of sense for consolidation.<p>\n    <p>So the thing about testing is that it's an extremely sticky service. Customers often stay with the same provider for decades, and service levels matter a lot. They matter more than price. Testing is typically a really low-cost service in the context of product value, but it's mission critical. And to give you a sense of the scale, in food testing, food test spending runs at about 0.1% to 0.2% of global food turnover. So it's a mission-critical service, not very important in terms of pricing. The other thing about testing that is really important is that it's really scalable and there are advantages to being large in a given market.<p>\n    <p>So Dr. Martin likes to make a comparison. He says the cost of running one assay twice a day is about 20% of the cost of running that same assay a thousand times a day. So you're talking about a 50-fold improvement in unit costs as you scale up at the extreme.

And so he decided to build it. And he built it by acquisition. And that was the playbook that he started with. And he has then applied that playbook over and over and over again in entering new markets. And what he does is he targets niche markets that are limited in size, where there aren't that many assets to buy. So once he buys them, there's really not much left for a competitor to roll up.<p>\n    <p>And the goal of Eurofins is typically to be the number one scale competitor in any market it enters within five years. Preferably, it will be two to five times the size of the second-largest competitor. And so this playbook has been what he's been running ever since he started the business in 1987. And it makes a lot of sense.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"gilles-martins-playbook-for-acquisitions-10415\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gilles-martins-playbook-for-acquisitions-10415\" aria-label=\"gilles martins playbook for acquisitions 10415 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gilles Martin’s playbook for acquisitions (1:04:15)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>有趣的是，其他大型測試公司，如SGS、Intertech、Bureau Veritas，雖然也有進行收購，但他們從未像Gilles Martin對此任務的投入和專注那樣進行收購。因此，它們的業務運作非常不同，增長速度也大不相同。<p>\n    <p>讓這一切變得美妙的是，如果我可以總結一下，他們在測試領域擁有強大的規模經濟：如果你給我一千個測試，而不是十個，我可以給你更好的價格。此外，這樣做還能帶來大量的客戶黏性，因為客戶通常不願意開始選擇其他實驗室。所以，他們不會輕易轉換服務商。因此，當你將這些規模經濟與客戶黏性結合起來，你就擁有了巨大的定價權力，並且成為了進入市場的門檻。因為即使新進者匹配了規模，他們也無法吸引到Eurofins的客戶。如果我理解正確，Chase，除了這些之外，Martin先生在收購方面也表現出極為嚴謹的紀律，專注於建設一個像洋蔥一樣的結構——你從食品純度開始，這是非常法國化的東西，然後你開始圍繞它構建，以擴大你可以為多個行業提供的測試範圍。這樣理解對嗎？<p>\n    <p>對的。他甚至更具體地從葡萄酒開始，你幾乎想不出更具... 我是說，這真的是非常頑固的法國式東西。這是一項令人驚嘆的業務。你能給我們介紹一下公司規模的數據嗎？我們談論的是哪些數字？<p>\n    <p>是的。所以，收入，出乎意料的，超過50億歐元，EBITDA為15億歐元，你可以把它看作是約10億歐元的EBIT或EBITA。市值大約是220億歐元，企業價值為240億歐元。所以，從任何角度來看，這都不是一家便宜的公司。這是我們應該深入探討的部分。其中一些收益與COVID有關，但公司仍在相對較快的速度增長，且COVID測試的需求持續時間比我們最初預期的要長。因此，我不預期收益會顯著回落。<p>\n    <p>我認為這家公司有趣的地方之一是，當Gilles Martin進行收購時，這是一個非常分散的行業。市場上有數萬家實驗室，其中許多是家庭式的小型公司，科學家們經營著非常專業的利基市場。他會以盈虧平衡的價格收購其中的一些公司。這些公司是盈虧平衡的運營，Eurofins可以在一年內將它們的EBITDA利潤率提高到20%。然而，總體而言，這些收購對利潤率會有一定壓力。<p>\n    <p>此外，Eurofins還進行了大量的綠地實驗室創建，這些實驗室需要三年才能達到盈虧平衡。因此，它們也會對利潤率造成壓力。並且，為了與競爭對手區分開來，他們在數字化和專有實驗室信息管理系統上投入了大量資金。這同樣會對當前的收益產生壓力。因此，Eurofins進行了許多痛苦的步驟，這些步驟是公開競爭者普遍不願意進行的，因為這會對他們的短期利潤率造成重大且有害的影響。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>And it's interesting that other large testing companies like SGS, like Intertech, like Bureau Veritas, they do acquire, but they've never done it with the same level of intent and focus that Gilles Martin has brought to the task. And as a result, they're very different businesses and they have very different growth rates.<p>\n    <p>What is wonderful about it is that, if I can summarize, they have powerful economies of scale on testing, that I can offer you a better price if you give me a thousand tests instead of 10. In addition, there's a lot of customer captivity associated with that because customers are going to be reluctant to start sampling other labs. So they're going to be reluctant to move away. So you combine these economies of scale with this sort of customer captivity, and all of a sudden you have enormous pricing power and you're the tier in entry. Because even if you match the scale, the entrant won't be able to attract the customers of Eurofins away, and it seems to me if I understand you correctly, Chase, that in addition, Mr. Martin has been incredibly disciplined in terms of acquisitions, very focused, building kind of like an onion—you start with food purity, a very French thing I would say, and then you start building around it to increase the scope of the testing that you can do for several businesses. Do you understand that correctly?<p>\n    <p>Yes. And he started even more specifically with wine, which you couldn't think of anything more... I mean, this is just very incorrigible, this French thing. It's an amazing business. Can you give us a little of these magnitudes of the company? What are the numbers that we're talking about?<p>\n    <p>Yeah. So revenue, surprise, it's a little over 5 billion euro revenue, one and a half billion euro EBITDA, and you can think of it as about a billion in EBIT or EBITA. And the market cap is about 22 billion, enterprise value 24 billion euro. So not a cheap company by any measure. And that's something that we should get into a little bit. Some of those earnings are COVID-related, but the company is growing at a relatively quick pace, and the COVID testing is persisting longer than I think we originally anticipated. So I don't expect the earnings to go significantly backwards.<p>\n    <p>One of the things that I think is interesting about the business is that when Gilles Martin would acquire, it's a very fragmented business. So there are tens of thousands of labs out there. A lot of them are mom-and-pop shops, scientists who run very specific niches. A lot of them he would acquire at breakeven. They’d be breakeven operations, and Eurofins could take them to 20% EBITDA margins in the span of a year. However, generally speaking, the acquisitions are depressive to margins.<p>\n    <p>In addition, Eurofins does a lot of greenfield lab startups and they take three years to break even. So they are also depressive to margins. And in addition, in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors, they've invested an enormous amount into digitization and into proprietary laboratory information management systems. Again, depressive to current earnings. And so Eurofins has undertaken a lot of painful steps that public competitors generally were unwilling to undertake because the impact it would have on their near-term margins was significant and deleterious.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"why-hyperion-became-interested-in-eurofins-10742\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-hyperion-became-interested-in-eurofins-10742\" aria-label=\"why hyperion became interested in eurofins 10742 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why Hyperion became interested in Eurofins (1:07:42)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>所以我認為這一點非常重要。Gilles Martin仍然擁有公司三分之一的股份。因此，他將公司經營得像家族企業一樣。我是說，這是一家運營非常專業的公司，但在他的激勵機制方面，他將其當作自己的寶貝來經營。他對自己長期每股盈餘（EPS）增長的記錄感到非常驕傲。<p>\n    <p>所以，我認為我們不可能讓一家公司由一名被僱用的高管來經營，並期望它表現出相同的行為。我認為這對Eurofins來說是一個很大的優勢，因為它在過去30年中實施了這種“土地掠奪”（Land Grab）策略，專注於這些細分的測試領域，因為這些領域真的對其他人來說很容易被看見並打斷。如果比如說，像SGS這樣的一家大型公開競爭對手有更多的資本，它完全可以輕易地打斷這一過程，支配這些小型細分市場，但它就是沒有那個動力去接受其利潤率下降，並重金投資於未來的收益能力。這也是Eurofins成功的一個重要方面。我認為這也是我們的機會所在，因為通常，如果你把Eurofins放到螢幕上，你會看到它的投資回報率（ROIC）看起來是高個位數的。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>And so I think that's really important. Gilles Martin still owns a third of the company. And as a result, he runs it very much like a family business. I mean, it's very professionally run, but in terms of his incentives, he runs it like his baby. He's very proud of his track record of long-term EPS growth.<p>\n    <p>And so I just don't think that we could have gotten a public company managed by a hired gun to behave in the same way. And I think that's been a big advantage for Eurofins as it has executed this land grab over these niche testing areas over the last 30 years, because it really was there for anyone else to see and to interrupt. If SGS had, for instance, one of their large public competitors had more capital, it could have easily interrupted that process of dominating these small niches, but it just didn't have the motivation to watch its margins decline as it invested heavily for future earnings power. Just an important aspect of why Eurofins has succeeded. And I think that was also part of the opportunity for us, because typically, if you punched Eurofins up on the screen, you would see returns on invested capital that looked like they were in the high single digits.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-advantages-of-eurofins-having-a-founder-ceo-10856\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-advantages-of-eurofins-having-a-founder-ceo-10856\" aria-label=\"the advantages of eurofins having a founder ceo 10856 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The advantages of Eurofins having a founder CEO (1:08:56)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>即使在Jean Martin告訴我們他在增量資本投資上賺取20%回報的時候，情況仍然如此。這種再投資，實際上長時間掩蓋了這家公司的真實盈利能力。我認為另一個重要的因素是，Eurofins能夠如此迅速成長，實際上需要槓桿。這樣的終端市場非常重要。其關鍵點是，這些終端市場是非周期性的，並且它們的增長速度快於GDP，所有的市場都是如此。你所看的終端市場歷史上有大約7%的有機增長。這裡有一個極佳的有機增長勢頭。這家公司在2009年金融危機期間有機增長，在2020年疫情期間也有機增長。所以，你可以在不承擔過大風險的情況下將一些債務放在資產負債表上。他通常會以相當高的槓桿運營公司。今天公司槓桿不算高，因為得益於疫情，他們的盈利已經飆升。但是，考慮到市場的多元化和終端市場的非周期性，你可以放心地在這個資產負債表上放兩倍、三倍，甚至四倍的債務與EBITDA之間的比例。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>And that was the case, even when Jean Martin was telling us that he was earning 20% returns on his incremental capital investments. So that reinvestment, it really masked the true earnings power of the business for a very long time. I think the other thing that's important is that it required leverage to grow as quickly as Eurofins grew. And so the end market that they were operating in is really important. The important aspect of it is that these end markets are non-cyclical and they grow faster than GDP, all of them. You're looking at end markets that historically have grown organically at about 7%. There's a fantastic organic tailwind there. And the business grew organically in 2009 during the financial crisis. It grew organically in 2020 during the pandemic. So you can put some debt on the balance sheet without undue risk. And he's generally run the company with a significant amount of leverage. It's not very leveraged today because their earnings have really skyrocketed thanks to the pandemic. But you can safely put two times, three times, even four times debt to EBITDA on this balance sheet, given the diversification and the non-cyclicality of the end markets.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-importance-of-leverage-to-eurofins-growth-11024\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-importance-of-leverage-to-eurofins-growth-11024\" aria-label=\"the importance of leverage to eurofins growth 11024 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The importance of leverage to Eurofins’ growth (1:10:24)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>這也大大加速了他們的增長。這是一個很重要的觀點，正如你剛才所說，Chase，許多這些收購故事在某種程度上需要槓桿，這使得理解管理層的激勵變得更加重要，真的要監控那些收購，並且正確地選擇它們。對分析師來說，精確聚焦於收購過程的質量是至關重要的。在某種程度上，槓桿增加了風險，並且會對過程和分析施加更多壓力，你需要做更多的分析來評估，確保這些收購不會對你產生意外的負面影響。<p>\n    <p>非常重要。我認為在這兩個案例中，收購的規模也很關鍵。如果管理者為了保持增長而不斷擴大收購規模，這是令人擔憂的，這也是我們一直保持警惕的事情。你必須密切關注，即使是過去非常成功的管理者，你也必須確保他們沒有受到任何使命擴張或增長需求的影響，這些因素可能會迫使他們改變原來的標準。所以，我們在這次對話中引入了一個新環節，我非常喜歡，那就是：你們最近在讀什麼書？有什麼書或幾本書推薦給我們的聽眾嗎？也許，Will，我們可以從你開始。<p>\n    <p>最近，我有很多書在讀。有些我最近才讀完。讓我來說說，我現在讀的是《噪音》（Noise），由Kahneman、Savoni和Sunstein合著；還有一些科學書籍，《恐龍的興衰》（The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs），這本書由Brizate寫，非常有趣。不知道你們知不知道，但在地獄溪層（Hell's Creek formation）中，三角龍的市場份額是40%，而暴龍的市場份額也是40%。 三角龍的市場份額？你說對了。我會去聽的。確實，我對市場份額了解得非常透徹。是的。然後是Walter Isaacson的《突破》（Breakthrough），關於CRISPR的書，還有《千個大腦》（A Thousand Brains），這是Jeff Hawkins關於大腦皮層的最新理論。我會推薦的那本書，我認為它在投資書籍中稍微低調一些，不算是經典書籍，但卻非常值得閱讀，那就是Ed Wachenheim的《普通股票與常識》（Common Stocks and Common Sense）。他是一位偉大的投資者，並且在他職業生涯中收集的許多投資案例研究中，清晰地表達了他的思考過程。這本書寫得非常好，內容也非常有啟發性。</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>And that has supercharged their growth as well. This is an important point in a way, which is many of these roll-up stories, in a way, as you were saying just a moment ago Chase, you require the leverage, and that makes it even more important to understand the incentives of management, to really monitor those acquisitions, select them properly. Really, for the analyst to zero in on the quality of the process by which acquisitions are being made is absolutely key. In a way, leverage increases the risk and it puts more pressure on process and on the analysis that you need to do in order to assess that it's not going to blow up in your face, effectively.<p>\n    <p>Very important. And I think in these two cases, the size of the acquisitions is also important. It's scary if managers are scaling up their acquisitions to keep their growth going, and that's something we're always vigilant about. You have to be on the lookout for it. Even if it's a manager that has been extremely successful in the past, you have to make sure that there's no mission creep there or growth imperative that's causing them to change their criteria. So we're introducing a new segment to our conversation, which is one I love. And that is, what are you guys reading these days? And what book or books would you recommend to our listeners? So maybe Will, we can start with you.<p>\n    <p>So lately, I have a lot of books open. Some of them I finished recently. So I've got, let's see, Noise by Kahneman and Savoni and Sunstein. I've got some science books, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs by Brizate, which was fascinating. I don't know if you know, but the market share of triceratops in the Hell's Creek formation was 40% and T-Rex was 40%.<p>\n    <p>The market share of triceratops? There you have it. I'll listen to it. Exactly. I'm incredibly well-informed about market shares. Yes. And then Breakthrough by Walter Isaacson about CRISPR. And then A Thousand Brains, which is Jeff Hawkins' new theory about the neocortex. The one that I would recommend, which I think flies a little bit under the radar in terms of investing books, not one of the classics, is Common Stocks and Common Sense by Ed Wachenheim, who's a great investor and just writes so cogently through his thought process on a number of investment case studies that he's compiled over his career. One that I thought was extremely well-written and very informative.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"wills-recommended-reading-11243\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wills-recommended-reading-11243\" aria-label=\"wills recommended reading 11243 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Will’s recommended reading (1:12:43)</h2>\n<div class=\"bilingual-container\">\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column chinese-column\">\n    <p>當然，我可以繼續談談《噪音》這本書。我們剛才討論過偏見，偏見顯然是一種系統性偏離正確過程的情況，而噪音則是一種非系統性的錯誤集合。那麼當你閱讀這本書或理解它的基本論點時，你是否發現其中的一些概念適用於你的投資過程，以及你們如何管理資金？噪音對投資者來說意味著什麼？相比之下，偏見則更加清晰明確？<p>\n    <p>噪音本質上就是錯誤或過程中的變異性。因此，這本書建議或記錄了一些噪音審核。這是我希望不久後能引入公司的一項措施，我想對我們的分析師進行噪音審核，並展示一個案例研究，告訴他們：「這是一家公司，我們可以識別或去識別它，並說它擁有這些特定的財務屬性。它的盈餘倍數是這樣，盈餘走勢是這樣，負債也有這麼多。你會如何給它估值？」我很好奇結果會如何。我們將回來報告結果，看看到底會有什麼差異。<p>\n    <p>在書中，他們提到了在一家投資公司進行噪音審核的例子，那其實就是我做的。所以我已經做過這個，並且每年都會要求我的學生進行這個。我總是覺得結果會比實際情況小，但我們看看你們做的時候會不會像我當時那樣驚訝。所以你在書中看到的數字，實際上是我做的噪音審核。<p>\n    <p>真有趣！太棒了。</p>\n    <p>所以 Chase，對於你來說，過去或現在，有哪些書籍你喜歡，或者會推薦給我們的聽眾呢？<p>\n    <p>不全是投資書籍，但最近我讀了一些書。其中我非常喜歡的一本是《How Not to Be Wrong》由 Jordan Ellenberg 撰寫。這是一本關於數學思維力量的著作，聽起來可能有點枯燥，但實際上並不這樣。它非常有趣，Ellenberg 是一位出色的作家，他自己是數學天才，所以非常有資格來寫這本書。我的太太現在讓我讀一本叫做《Switch》的書。她從事非營利領域工作，正在嘗試改變醫生的醫療方式，而《Switch》這本書探討的是如何在改變困難時進行改變，全部是關於改變心理學的，對我來說這非常迷人。<p>\n    <p>有一點我會建議大家做的是，閱讀那些最優秀和最聰明的資本配置者的年度信件。我指的是商界領袖。因此，在這方面，我現在正在讀一本書，叫做《Invent and Wander》，是我一位朋友也是投資者的推薦書。這本書是 Jeff Bezos 的集體著作。沃倫·巴菲特的集體著作由 Lawrence Cunningham 編輯，對我有很大的影響。我認為即使某些東西並未被比擬或編成文集，仍然有很多值得閱讀的人，而 Mark Leonard 就是其中之一。Will，我不確定 Mark 的信件是否已經被收集過了。<p>\n    <p>它們在網上有公開，Lawrence Cunningham 也在那裡的董事會，所以他也許正在整理。<p>\n    <p>是的。這些就是我最近一直在深入閱讀的書籍。<p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"bilingual-column english-column\">\n    <p>Well, can I follow up on Noise? We talked about just a few moments ago about bias, and bias is obviously a sort of a systematic departure from proper process. And noise is sort of this unsystematic set of mistakes. So when you went through that book or even understood the basic thesis, did you find some of those concepts apply to how you did your own process and how you guys think about managing money? What does noise mean for investors versus bias, which is much clearer?<p>\n    <p>Well, noise is just, essentially, I think it's just mistakes or variability in process. And so one of the things that the book recommends or documents is noise audits. That's the thing that I want to bring to the firm very shortly, is to do a noise audit and to just present a case study to our analysts and say, \"There's this company, and we can identify or de-identify it and say it has these certain financial attributes. It's this earnings multiple and this earnings trajectory, it has this much debt. How would you value it?\" And I wonder what the disparity is going to be. We'll have to report back on that and see.<p>\n    <p>So in the book, they mentioned a noise audit at an investment firm, and that was one that I did. So I've done that and I have to do it with my students every year. So I always think the numbers will be smaller than they are. So we'll see if you guys are as surprised as I was when I ran it. So the numbers you see in the book, and it's toward the beginning of the book, that was actually a noise audit that I did.<p>\n    <p>That's so funny. It's great.<p>\n    <p>So Chase, books for you, past, present, what you like, what you'd recommend to our listeners?<p>\n    <p>Not all of them would be investment books, but I've been reading recently. One that I loved is How Not to be Wrong by Jordan Ellenberg. It's a treatise on the power of mathematical thinking. And that sounds dry, but it's not. It's really entertaining, and he's a fantastic writer. And he himself was a math prodigy, so well-qualified to write about it. My wife has me reading a book called Switch right now. She's in the nonprofit world and she's trying to make some changes to the way doctors practice medicine, and Switch is about how to change things when change is hard. It's all about the psychology of change, and I find that fascinating.<p>\n    <p>One thing I would recommend people do is read the annual letters of the very best and smartest capital allocators out there. And I'm talking about businessmen. So in that vein, I am launching into Invent and Wander right now on the recommendation of a friend who's also an investor. That's just the collective writings of Jeff Bezos. The collective writings of Warren Buffett, published by Lawrence Cunningham, had a huge effect on me. And I think even if something hasn't been analogized or put into a compendium, there are many people out there worth reading. And Mark Leonard is among them. Will, I don't know if Mark's letters have been collected yet.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>","headings":[{"value":"Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb (RCG)
